            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT has been thought requiſite by ſome, whoſe judgements deſerve the eſteem which every body has of them, that the Treatiſes ſhould be anſwered, which have appeared under the Title of <hi>The Jeſuites Loyalty.</hi> To thoſe among whom we live, in a common ſubjection to the ſame Government, but with different ſentiments in Religion, we owe the ſatisfaction of knowing what we hold in matters ſo much concerning civil obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And it is not juſt that thoſe whoſe Tenets differ from thoſe of theſe Authors, ſhould paſs for approvers of Opinions which they diſapprove. Theſe Treatiſes being attributed to Catholicks, and the doctrines contained in them to the Church: Ignorance and obſtinacy, wickedneſs and damnable error being laid to the charge of thoſe who are otherwiſe perſwaded; Proteſtants, if no Catholick diſowned them, would have but too much reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, we were all of one minde in theſe matters, ſilence in ſuch a caſe amounting to little leſs then Confeſſion. And though they were diſowned, yet if no body ſaid why, the diſowners would go near to paſs for the ſtrange people which the zeal of theſe Authors repreſents them, and Proteſtants, with extreme ſcandal to our Religion, apprehend, that the only good ſubjects among us were the worſt of Catholicks, if Catholicks at all. It was thought neceſſary to prevent an apprehenſion of ſuch bad conſequence, both to Religion, and our ſelves, and ſhew they ſwerve neither from Religion nor Reaſon, and are not ſeduc't but convinc't into their perſwaſions, after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ue weight of all that is offered to the contrary. Beſides an anſwer ſeemed due to the Church, our Neighbour, and
<pb facs="tcp:53776:3"/> our ſelves. The Church is wronged, when doctrines are put upon her which ſhe holds not, and much more when thoſe doctrines are both falſe and pernicious. Not to remove the ſcandal is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to concur to it. Our Neighbour is wronged when coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit coyn is offered him for current: ſince he will finde little other in theſe Treatiſes, it is the part of an honeſt man to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn him. We are wronged by characters which we deſerve not, and are not to be blamed if we have no minde to paſs for Ignorant, and obſtinate and wicked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n; though in truth, Religion is more concerned then we, that who are ſound in Allegiance appear not unſound in Religion. In ſhort, ſince it becomes Catholicks to deal ſincerely, and embrace no Tenets, eſpecially in what concerns their duty to God &amp; <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which fear the light; theſe Authors deſerve praiſe for owning fairly what they hold, and why, and it was thought fit to imitate their example. For theſe reaſons I would not but concur with the opinion of my friends, that an Anſwer was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but yet I could have wiſht the task had been impoſed on ſome body elſe. I have not ventured on it but at the ſollicitation of thoſe whom I could not refuſe, and that in default of another. But while others, ſome more concerned, and all more able, for ſeveral reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects declined it, I thought it better to do it, as I could ſcurvily, then leave it undone. I concern my ſelf only with the <hi>what is ſaid,</hi> and meddle not with the <hi>who ſaid it,</hi> as neither knowing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, nor thinking I have any thing to do to enquire. So the Gold be weight, it imports not what hand holds the ſcales. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as the tartneſs with which too many ſeaſon their writings, is to my reliſh wonderful unſavoury, I am not ſorry at an Ignorance which preſerves me from the Temptation. For though I would, I cannot reflect on thoſe I know not. If any thing ſlip leſs ſmooth from my pen, I entreat the Reader to look upon it as a ſlip, which had I been aware, I had avoided.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST TREATISE.</head>
            <p>OF the three Arguments, which make up the ſubſtance of theſe three Treatiſes, the firſt in ſome reſpects, ſeems far the beſt; the other two are more proper to amuſe, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and look more like products of wit and fancy, ſuch as a fertile invention may multiply without end on any ſubject, then of a ſetled judgment. They rather skirmiſh then ſight, and ſo as ſtill to preſerve their Reſerves intire. But the firſt fairly engages the Triarii, and gives us the comfort of <hi>Alexander,</hi> to meet with all the enemies force at once. In truth it is the only proper Topick. For obedience to Princes being evidently taught by Faith, leſs then Faith will hardly ſerve to juſtify diſobedience in caſe of Depoſition. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in other reſpects I cannot but think it an ill choſen, and worſe managed Topick.</p>
            <p>For firſt, it is at moſt but an Argument <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> ſuch a one as may ſtop a mans mouth, but contributes nothing to clear the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. It is good only againſt a Catholick, and He, if he be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the proof this Author alledges, that the Church truly held, what he ſays ſhe did, is put to ſilence, and muſt allow the concluſion true in vertue of his obligation, <hi>to believe as the Church believes.</hi> But yet ſees nothing of that Truth himſelf, nor can tell how to make it out, or defend his Church, if it be objected againſt her, that ſhe holds an untruth. To an Adverſary it ſignifies nothing, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to confirm him in his prejudice againſt the Church, when ſhe is made to require the belief of things, which he may ſee inconſiſtent with Truth. However all is carried in the dark, the Catholick run
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53776:4"/> down as with a boyſterous ſhock at Blind-mans-buff, but neither ſatisfied himſelf, nor able to ſatisfy any body elſe, the reſt left without the leaſt glimps of light. In ſhort, it is a Topick proper to fright a timerous conſcience into a blinde obedience, but leaves the underſtanding altogether at a loſs.</p>
            <p>Again, it will not do at laſt, as he aſſumes, <hi>The Church has held it,</hi> and thence infers, it muſt be true. Another may aſſume, It is not true: and thence a Catholick infer, <hi>the Church has not held it;</hi> and an Adverſary, that the Church has erred. In either caſe, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity come to be examined, whether the point be true or no, and this by Arguments independent of the Authority of the Church. For if the Catholick by any Arguments can prove it is not true:—<hi>the Church never held it,</hi> is to another Catholick as undenyable, as his conſequence, <hi>the Church hath held it,</hi> therefore it is true. At leaſt there is no avoiding it with an Adverſary: For who acknowledges the Church has held it, and cannot ſhew it is not an error, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mediums</hi> then the Churches holding it, cannot acquit the Church from having held an error. Wherefore ſince of neceſſity it muſt come to this at laſt, it had been a great deal better to have begun there at firſt, and never troubled us with a Topick, which even if it hold, makes us not a jot the wiſer, and which when we have taken a great deal of pains to examine, leaves us expoſed to as much in examining another.</p>
            <p>Beſides, conſidering the circumſtances in which we live, I know not what worſe office he could have done his fellow Catholicks, and indeed the Church it ſelf. She is daily traduced with holding do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines inconſiſtent with civil government. There is no way to clear her, that I know, but by denying that ſhe holds thoſe doctrines, or that thoſe doctrines are inconſiſtent. This Gentleman aſſiſts the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with his learned Syllogiſms, and fixes the doctrines on the Church, and then leaves her to ſhift for her ſelf, with the aſperſion of holding doctrines inconſiſtent with Government, unleſs he would ſhew them otherwiſe. To leave her thus with the matter of fact confeſt, her Adverſaries at liberty to conclude her guilty, and her friends uninſtructed how to make out her innocence, in my opinion ſhews that inconſiderate love is ſometimes more prejudicial then profeſt hate; and I think more fore-ſight would have become his learning, and more concern for her honour his zeal.</p>
            <p>To draw a little nearer, I obſerve, it is nothing but the old diſh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53776:4"/> newly, and not much differently, cookt, the ſame overſod bean ſtill. Only whereas uſually the inconvenience urged is, that <hi>unleſs the doctrine in queſtion be true; the Church has erred,</hi> he chooſes to word it, <hi>The Church has been in a damnable error of belief, and ſin of practice, a wicked and blinde Church, a Synagogue of Satan,</hi> &amp;c. This ſounds a little more big and frightful, but ſignifies much what the ſame. For the reſt, 'tis but what is met with every where. When the proof comes, on which he lays the ſtreſs, there is the fact of <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. the <hi>Councils of Lateran</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> with the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-places, objected and anſwered by every body, who meddle with the queſtion, according as they are for the affirmative or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Theſe things, if they had been ſatisfactory, would have been ſo in other mens Writings, the diſpute long ſince ended, and the pains of tranſcribing them afreſh ſpared. But ſince he knows they were not, methinks he ſhould have bethought himſelf of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, to make them ſatisfactory, then barely to tranſcribe them.</p>
            <p>However to make a formal buſineſs of it, this proof is divided into 6. Heads. <hi>All which if he can ſhew, he hopes it will be granted a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof.</hi> Sure he has been uſed to deal with very froward people, ſuch who will not be content unleſs it be ſyllogiſtically proved to them, that the ſun ſhines at noon: or elſe he is as unlucky at difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſome at muſick, who praiſe and diſpraiſe ſtill in the wrong place. Was there ever ſuch a pleaſant <hi>If?</hi> or did any man, beſides himſelf, ever doubt, whether thoſe things might be ſhewn, which every body, who knows any thing of the queſtion, knows were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in diſpute, but openly acknowledged on all hands? For ſo it is with the main of what he brings, though in ſome particulars he has the ill fortune to be out. I am fully perſwaded that neither the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors, nor the reſt of the Gentlemen, who it ſeems are out of his favour, would, to do him a pleaſure, ſtick to yeild him freely, perhaps more then he asks, without ſtaying to be for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'t to a confeſſion by the rack of his ſevere Quotations.</p>
            <p>Alas the difficulty lies not in the matter of fact-which is beyond <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> ſufficiently agreed, but in this, whether that matter of fact ſufficiently prove what is pretended from it. When he comes to this, all he does is to <hi>hope</hi> it over, and leave it to take its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. That a Scholler ſhould treat a queſtion of this concern in this manner! Keep a pother about the premiſes, which no body denies,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53776:5"/> and expect the concluſion, which no body grants, ſhould be yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his confidence without any, ſo much as offer at proof that it follows, or is a good concluſion, which yet is the only thing in queſtion! He knows that all, who diſſent from him, refuſe to grant what he hopes to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the reſt, who have produced the ſame things, with as much and as likely hope as he. He knows that what he tells us is no news; that all has been examined and ſifted over and over again, and that after all, there are who remain firm againſt him. Can it be poſſible a man of learning ſhould think to <hi>hope</hi> theſe people out of their Judgments? That they ſhould for his ſake relent, and profeſs that to be true which they think to be falſe? Change all on a ſudden, and that without any motive? For the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives he propoſes, he knows move them not. When a ſcholler tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s from proving to hoping, and expects from the good nature of the Readers what he ſhould force from them, whether they will or no, by the unreſiſtable evidence of his diſcourſe, I for my part think he has a great deal more reaſon to fear then <hi>hope,</hi> at leaſt were it my caſe, I am ſure I ſhould not be altogether ſo confident.</p>
            <p>However it be, the Argument in ſhort is this: Do but grant me that what you and every body knows has been done, proves the Church engaged for my doctrine, and then I will prove the Church is engaged for my doctrine, and that 'tis heretical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what you will, to oppoſe it. This is the long and the ſhort of the learned Syllogiſms, and elaborat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Quotations. Which if any one will take for a good Argument, he may fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me. But I muſt needs profeſs I never ſaw worſe Topick worſe managed; and am heartily afflicted to ſee a queſtion ſo ſtrangely handled, in which, to ſay nothing of ſome temporal conſiderations not altogether to be ſlighted, our very duty to God and <hi>Caeſar</hi> is concerned.</p>
            <p>But not to affront his pains and zeal with an anſwer ſo general, let us caſt a view on particulars. He undertakes to prove, that the opinion, againſt which he writes, is <hi>Erroneous in Faith, Temerarious, and Impious.</hi> Never were ill names worſe coupled. This is as much to ſay, you Sir, with whom I am very angry, are a Raſcal and a Villain, and beſides cannot put of your hat with a grace, or make a handſome leg, or ſome ſuch diminiſhing aggravation; which none, but a very merry enemy would uſe. <hi>Haeretical,</hi> and <hi>Impious</hi> are ſins of the firſt magnitude. <hi>Temerarious,</hi> which for all its great ſound is no more but plain <hi>Raſh,</hi> is a moderate blundring fault, of which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53776:5"/> many an honeſt man, eſpecially in our nation, is guilty, even he ſometimes who ſpeaks againſt raſhneſs. Neither do I mention this for any great matter there is in it, but to obſerve by the way, that he was ſo intent upon heaping harſh names on the Tenet, againſt which he diſputes, that he minded not much what they ſignified.</p>
            <p>There follow the learned Syllogiſms concerning which I ſhall only ſay, He has not weaved his web ſo faſt but that it might perhaps be unravel'd at every ſtitch. There is play enough for a Gameſter who would take all advantages. Who would examin what made an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or Practice damnable? whether what is damnable in its own nature, be ſo in all circumſtances, and particularly in thoſe in which the things he alledges were practiſed, whether the Church act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as a Church, or be reſponſible for all that is done by her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers, or Children; and whether in the caſes inſiſted on by him; with the reſt of the many points of which he gives occaſion to diſcourſe, might peradventure ſtop the career before it came to the convincing Quotations, and put him to the charge of more proofs, then thoſe he has provided.</p>
            <p>But ſince I am at liberty, I conceive it beſt to gratify his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deny juſt where he would have me. For indeed to deny in the wrong place without neceſſity, may I fear ſhew ſomething diſobliging. 'Tis as if a man ſhould rudely call for mutton to him who had provided Capon and Pheaſant. I joyn iſſue with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where he deſires and expects I ſhould, upon the firſt part of his ſecond <hi>Minor,</hi> and deny that the Church at any time has believed and practiſed, as he pretends. And this becauſe I believe it will be found, the Church, or rather men of the Church, were in thoſe times, as now, divided in their ſentiments of this buſineſs. Some were for ſuch a power, as he would have in the Pope, ſome were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, both acted according to their ſeveral perſwaſions. And I conceive that what is done by one part of the Church, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by another, proves not the Act, and much leſs the Faith of the Church.</p>
            <p>Again, although there had been no difference of ſentiments and practices, I do not underſtand how the Church can be engaged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe proceeded on thoſe grounds, on which alone the Church, as a Church, or Congregation of faithful can proceed. To this I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend two things neceſſary: Firſt, that the point have been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally revealed by Chriſt: and 2dly, that this revelation have been
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53776:6"/> preſerved by an uninterrupted and uniform practice of the Faithful. If any, or all, of thoſe who make the Church believe or act on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds then theſe, I conceive they believe and act, not as a Church, or as faithful, but as men, or ſchollars, or in ſome other capacity. And becauſe, for any thing appears in his Argument, theſe conditions may be wanting, I deny any engagement of the Church in his concerns, and for the ſame reaſon, his laſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence too, conceiving, whatever he may hope, that though he do ſhew all he undertakes, it will not follow that the <hi>Church has belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, taught, and practiſed,</hi> as he contends.</p>
            <p>And now in truth we are at an end of our Argument; at leaſt what remains belongs to him, not me. His conſequence ſince it is denied, muſt be proved, if he will have it paſs, and till then there is no more for me to do. It is neither needful, nor indeed much to purpoſe to examine farther what he ſays, if what he ſays will not prove his intent. However ſince in likelihood ſomething may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, which though unneceſſary, may yet be grateful to the Reader, let us hear at leaſt what his witneſſes ſay. Kings and Emperors and Popes carry with them too much reſpect to be deny'd audience.</p>
            <p>We are told then, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th. threatned the French King, and his ſubjects, and depoſed <hi>Henry</hi> 4th. King of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> Beſides that he formerly taught this doctrine to the Church, and called the contrary wicked folly and madneſs, as bad as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Farther that <hi>Paul</hi> the 5th. forbad the Oath of Allegiance; <hi>Innocent</hi> the 10th. cenſured the negative ſubſcribers; and <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th. the Iriſh Remonſtrance. And all this dilated with ſeveral circumſtances, not forgetting the very year in which each thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Vouchers brought, and exactly quoted for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>I verily believe this exactneſs might have been ſpared. Theſe things are too well known to need more ado about them then bare naming. I wiſh they were not, for the honour of Popes and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we allow to their ſacred and ſupreme dignity. And could they be concealed, I for my part would rather loſe an opportunity of ſhewing Erudition, then publiſh them. But ſince this Gentleman has thought fit to bring them once again upon the ſtage, what will he make of them? All this is in two words, Popes have appeared for the depoſing doctrine all the ways they can. And what then? Is all that Popes think true; all that Popes do, well done? Had he firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53776:6"/> ſhewn the Actions good, and opinion true, he had deſerved well of Popes, by ſhewing them to have abetted goodneſs and Truth: But that remaining in queſtion, to expoſe their actions to the ſame queſtion, is, I fear, no very good piece of ſervice to them. And 'tis a worſe to Chriſtianity to aſſume their proceedings in proof of a point of Faith. The Authority of Popes, he knows well, ſtirs not the ballance, unleſs their Infallibility be caſt into the ſcales. And for that point, I refer it to himſelf, if it be any more then a probable opinion, and that even according to his own value, if he hold it. For he is not to learn that every body ſets not the ſame rate upon it, many holding it very improbable and very falſe to boot. Now if it become a ſchollar to ſuppoſe that point, (for he offers not any where to prove it) a point upon which all the ſtreſs lies, and which he knows is ſtrongly conteſted; I cannot think it becomes a Catholick to make a probable opinion a premiſe to infer a point of Faith. For this is plainly to make his Faith, a probable, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and for ought he can tell, falſe Faith. I would entreat him the next time he writes, to have more concern for Chriſtianity, and leſs for his eſpouſed opinion, and in the mean time, change his hopes of having his Inference paſs, into a deſire that it may not. For I muſt hope, with a confidence ſomething better grounded, that God will have more care of his Church; then to ſuffer her Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Probabilities, if they be ſo much, and the Rock on which he has built her, crumble away into ſlippery ſand.</p>
            <p>But now to ſee how he ſets off his ware; how like an Artiſt he covers the weakneſs of what he ſays, by the ſtrong expreſſions in which he cloaths it, and ſtrives by his big words to fright us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an apprehenſion there is ſomething in it, if we could finde it! <hi>If I ſhew,</hi> ſays he, <hi>That Popes have taught it as ſound doctrine;</hi> As if they, or any body in their wits, can be imagined to have taught any, as unſound doctrine. No body yet ever cry'd ſtinking Fiſh. <hi>Proving it from Scripture and Tradition:</hi> That Scripture ſhould have been pretended is no ſuch wonder, or praiſe. No Hereſy, that I know, but has attempted as much. But for Tradition he muſt pardon me, if I ſuſpend my judgement till I hear what his witneſſes ſay. For to me it ſeems a riddle, that Tradition ſhould be ſo much as pretended. <hi>And condemned the contrary, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Faith, pernicious folly, and madneſs, and inflicted cenſures on them that held it:</hi> As if people did not uſe to give hard names to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53776:7"/> their Adverſaries, and do all they can againſt them. Many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man has been called knave. The queſtion is whether thoſe opinions, and thoſe men, deſerved thoſe cenſures, and that harſh language; if they did not, they had the worſe fortune; to be wrongfully aſperſed heretofore, and for no other reaſon but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo, concluded guilty now.</p>
            <p>Again, we are told, that <hi>Gregory the 7th depoſed Henry the 4th in a Patriarchal Council.</hi> I am very ſorry he did ſo, and wiſh with all my heart, truth would give me leave to deny that fact. But for the Patriarchal Council, I muſt again ſuſpend till better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. For I ſuſpect few of the Nations belonging to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate were repreſented in that Council, ſave the <hi>Italians,</hi> and know a good part of the <hi>German</hi> Nation by Counter-Councils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves directly oppoſed it. Yet though it were true, I believe it does not, even in his own judgement come home to his purpoſe. That <hi>he did it ex Cathedra, as Vicar of Chriſt, and ſucceſſor of S. Peter,</hi> &amp;c. I wonder in virtue of what other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he could pretend to proceed; or how he could act at all without pretending ſome: And for the myſtery of doing it <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> he may, if he pleaſe diſpute it out with <hi>Launoy,</hi> for I muſt confeſs I do not well underſtand it. That <hi>this ſentence he publiſht to the Empire in a Breve, and his Legats in ſeveral Nations of Chriſtendom.</hi> Since it cannot be imagined he intended to make a ſecret of it, which way ſhould he publiſh it, but by Letters, and Meſſengers? Laſtly (for <hi>I</hi> will mention no more) <hi>that he did not only believe, but formally teach this doctrine to the Church by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons publiſht in a Patriarchal Council at Rome;</hi> for which he cites the famous <hi>Dictatus Papae.</hi> This of all the reſt, might in my opinion have beſt been ſpared, both for his own and the Popes cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. For my part I conceive it becomes me to uſe a little more reſpect then he has done, and not ſay all to which this objection tempts me. Had he imitated the prudence of thoſe, who though they balkt nothing which they thought material, yet forbore to meddle with theſe <hi>Dictatus,</hi> I believe he had deſerved better of ſome body. If he have entertained a fondneſs for them, and will uphold them whatever come ont, let him if he pleaſe, maintain them againſt <hi>Withrington,</hi> who flatly denys they were defined by the Council. As for me I will have no more to do with them, only I would gladly know whether he do in earneſt believe all they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53776:7"/> contain. If he do not, methinks it is not fair play to obtrude on others, what he believes not himſelf: If he do, it is the leſs wonder he makes the Churches Faith but probable, ſince he can be content with one, to make the beſt on't, very improbable, and very ſingular. For I dare ſay there is not one man in the Church beſides, who believes as he does.</p>
            <p>Now all this ſeems to me, but much ado about nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſum total of all theſe, and if there were as many more, particulars, amounts to no more then this, <hi>Popes did it.</hi> And for this I think he needed not have brought in his Bill; it would have paſt well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the groſs. But when he urges payment, people deſire firſt to be ſatisfyd whether they are obliged to diſcharge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Popes debts. He had done ſomething, if he had ſhewed we ſtood bound for them, obliged to juſtify all they have done in this particular, and to believe, and that with divine Faith, all was well done, and may and ought be imitated. But barely to ſhew they have done what before he ſet pen to paper, every body knew they have, and this with ſo much circumſtance and aggravation, is to take much pains where none needs, and none where they do. For all that, I cannot but acknowledge he is a great man in his way: Of all the places, which Art has invented for amplification, I think there is none wanting. There is the <hi>Who,</hi> and the <hi>What,</hi> the <hi>How,</hi> the <hi>Where,</hi> the <hi>Why,</hi> and all the reſt, not ſo much as the <hi>When</hi> forgotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which though a body would think not much material; it importing little, whether theſe things happen in 1074, or 1084, yet I know not how, his formal <hi>In Anno</hi> has its Energy. And though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the diſcourſe would have ſhewn better ſpoken, then writ, becauſe this way it looſes much of the advantage, which a ſolemn gravity, a pleaſing and emphatical delivery would give it, yet even this is tempting. For there are few who will not be apt to think there muſt needs be ſome ſence, where they ſee ſo much exactneſs, Authors ſo accurately quoted for every particular, and care taken of every Minute, circumſtance, even the very Year of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs to the next Head, it will not be amiſs to ſtop at a quotation or two by the way. Out of a letter of the depoſed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. he cites theſe words; <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I would Engliſh the period, if I knew how, but I cannot make out the gramatical conſtruction, to which there ſeems ſomething wanting. However, beſides the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis, of no great import, he leaves out two words, which as ſhort as they are, quite alter the ſence, <hi>viz. Te Teſte,</hi> or, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your own verdict.</hi> To ſay abſolutely, the Fathers allow me not to be judged, or, if you will, depoſed, but only for Hereſy, is much a different thing from ſaying, even according to your ſelf the Fathers allow me not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is what the Emperor ſays; to make him ſay otherwiſe is an evident ſalſification: Though I do not ſuſpect this Gentleman guilty of it. For I believe he has not ſeen the letter himſelf, but taken the quotation on truſt from ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who has not dealt faithfully.</p>
            <p>But yet there is no great force in it, though it paſs in his own terms. As for the firſt half of the period, the Emperor is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the right. For the Fathers do indeed teach, that ſoveraign Princes are to be left to the Tribunal of God. But for the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hereſy, which is in the ſecond part, I would gladly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to thoſe Fathers who made it. I have neither met with it my ſelf, nor heard of any who has found it ſo much as in any one of them. Nor do I know how to reconcile the ſecond part of the period with the firſt, this exception to the Fathers either doctrine or practice. For ſince they refer the judgement of a Prince to God alone, I ſee not how they can allow him to be judged by any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, even for Hereſy. Again Heretick Princes there were in their days, but Depoſition was never thought of. They have been excommunicated, but ſtill obeyed. The practice then of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was againſt this exception, it appears not, nay, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry does appear in their words: what neceſſity is there to believe the Emperor in this point? will he have Emperors make Articles of Faith too? depoſed, and if he credit his own quotations, Heretick, and Arch-Heretick Emperors? For his <hi>Henricians</hi> had their name from him.</p>
            <p>Again, he ſays, <hi>in a Dyet of the Empire there was no plea againſt the Popes Jurisdiction, no not by the Kings own Advocates.</hi> A wiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and much to purpoſe; as if people were obliged to ſay all they thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53776:8"/> one plea, now on another, as circumſtances direct their choice. In the conteſt between <hi>Paul</hi> the 5th. and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> it was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether they ſhould appeal from the Pope to a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and 'twas carried they ſhould not, becauſe they thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo to do. Otherwiſe they thought it lawful enough, and told their ſubjects they did therefore refuſe to make uſe of that remedy, to which their Anceſtors and other Princes had had recourſe in ſuch caſes, becauſe the apparent injuſtice of the ſentence againſt them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it not, Such was the caſe in hand: The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> met to examine and dicide the controverſy betwixt the Pope and Emperor according to the Canons, as he himſelf; out of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſpergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> obſerves: And he can finde fault the Popes jurisdiction was not queſtioned, when by agreement they were to proceed in another method. The Emperors friends thought him unjuſtly dealt withal, even according to the ordinary proceedings of Law, and becauſe they undertook to make this good in an aſſembly of the wiſeſt men of their Nation, does it therefore follow they had nothing elſe to ſay?</p>
            <p>But now come his witneſſes, who are to give in their evidence that the Pope proved this Doctrine by Tradition. This I have lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a good while, it ſeeming very ſtrange, that wiſe men, as Popes are, ſhould attempt a matter ſo unlikely to ſucceed.

But if he do think it worth inſiſting on, let him firſt try to make out againſt <hi>Launoy,</hi> that there ever was any ſuch thing. For he contends, that this ſo much canvaſt priviledge, is a meer forgery, and I apprehend he would not be very wiſe, who ſhould labour much in expounding a decree, which perhaps was never made. And yet they ſeem to be leſs wiſe who forged it; ſure they underſtood little either of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> or of the world, who make that wiſe and holy Pope, one who by his words and actions owned himſelf a ſubject to his Emperor, decree Depoſition, and not content with that, Damnation. For my part I never heard of any power left with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or his ſucceſſors to damn men, And have been taught all is <hi>in Aedificationem.</hi> So that even admitting the matter of fact, all that can be made of it, is at moſt a Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to fright people from wickedneſs by the apprehenſion of the miſchiefs which may attend it.</p>
            <p>Popes have hitherto furniſht matter for his diſcourſe, now he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Councils, and produces firſt <hi>the Council of Lateran, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted general Council, and the greateſt, for number of Prelates that ever were.</hi> Who had a minde to raiſe doubts, might peradventure finde ſomewhat to ſay to this confident Gentleman, and be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc't by the Authority even of a General Council too. For if this Council be ſo undoubtedly general, how hapned it that the <hi>Council of Florence</hi> cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d themſelves but the 8th. General Council? How came Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> no ignorant man in the Hiſtory of the Church, to be of that opinion? To the 8. General Councils held in the Eaſt, add the two he cites, of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> and leave out thoſe of <hi>Baſil, Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> The <hi>Council of Florence</hi> comes to be the eleventh, not the 8th. So that as undoubted a buſineſs as he makes it, there have it ſeems, been thoſe in the world who have doubted of it, or at leaſt not acknowledged it, which I think is as bad.</p>
            <p>But we will not fall out about this point. I am well content the Council be as general as he pleaſes. If he will think fit to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more wary another time, 'tis as much as I deſire. I cannot tell whether he foreſaw what I would have, but, as far as <hi>I</hi> ſee, he is reſolved to gratify me, being ſo wary in the reſt, that he makes no play at all. For he barely relates the matter of fact, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not to apply it to his concluſion, nor gives any hint whereby it may be gueſt what ſervice he would draw from it; So that I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53776:9"/> am ſomething at a loſs what to ſpeak to. <hi>I</hi> know indeed his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys end, but which way he means to get to it, am quite to ſeek; Becauſe he undertook to prove the not-depoſing doctrine Erroneous in Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Council (I ſuppoſe) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a <hi>Medium</hi> by which to make good that undertaking. Now how he will couple both ends to the middle, and out of this that a Canon was made, in which the depoſing doctrine is ſuppos'd, infer the contrary Erroneous in Faith, is the difficulty.</p>
            <p>For my part, I conceive, that Councils uſe to define thoſe things, which they intend we ſhould be obliged to believe, and have been told, that when they do not we are at liberty. I think he will not deny, that to make a Canon is one thing, to define another. I think he will not deny, that 'tis at leaſt current doctrine, that in Definitions, there is no neceſſity of believing more then the bare Definitions themſelves. Antecedents and Conſequents, the very Reaſons themſelves alledged for the Definition, are expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. I preſume too he will acknowledge, that Canons may be made on ſuppoſitions ſhort of the certainty of Faith, and known to be ſo. And if he will deny none of this, I cannot ſee how he can hope it will not be denyed to him, that becauſe this Canon ſuppoſes his doctrine, it follows that the Council did ſuppoſe it to be a point of Faith: and much leſs, if it did, that the ſuppoſition was true.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell, as I ſaid before, whether he would make his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this manner; but I think he ſhould in this or the like. And then <hi>Bellarmins</hi> doctrine followed generally by Divines, and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think by himſelf, to my apprehenſion hinders it from conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. However, as it has been obſerved before me, this is a plain caſe, and which cannot be denyed, that the Act in queſtion is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of ſomething to be done, not a Definition of any thing to be believed, and that we who are not to believe more then barely the Definition ſhould be obliged to believe what is not defined, is a morſel of too hard digeſtion till he have chewed it better. It is but little ſhort of believing it is defined, becauſe it is not defined. For he would have it believed, becauſe it has been decreed, or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and Decreeing, and Suppoſing are plainly not-Defining. If he will have it at leaſt obliging as to practice, he muſt firſt make out that obligation from our National Laws; otherwiſe I muſt tell him, that is a pretence which would have expoſed a man to puniſhment, even in Catholick times.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53776:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> paſs by the Replys he makes to the anſwers, which he objects againſt himſelf; not that <hi>I</hi> think them ſatisfactory, but becauſe <hi>I</hi> think it needleſs to meddle with them. <hi>Withrington</hi> had the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of them long ſince, and has acquainted the world why he would not take them for good payment. If <hi>I</hi> thought it to purpoſe, it were as eaſy for me to borrow Anſwers, as for him to borrow Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>Next, he brings in the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which he ſerves juſt as he did the former; tells the matter of fact, which every body knew before, and ſets it off with his emphatical aggravations, and leaves us to gueſs what it makes to his purpoſe. If people will be good natur'd, and allow his concluſion follows from it, he is the more beholding to them; if they will ſtand upon their terms, and expect to ſee how 'tis connected with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> premiſes, they may expect for him. If they cannot finde it out of themſelves, 'tis like to remain hidden for any care he takes. Now it had been conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have ſaid ſomething to this point; otherwiſe a particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in a particular caſe, with particular circumſtances, ſeems not altogether ſo much as a Canon. This Emperor had made a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſubmiſſion to the Church, which how far it authoriz'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt him, <hi>I</hi> cannot tell, ſure <hi>I</hi> am, it is a circumſtance not always found.</p>
            <p>What he would make of this buſineſs, he alone can tell. What <hi>I</hi> can imagine, is, that becauſe this. Council, or Pope in preſence of the Council, did depoſe the Emperor, they ſuppoſed, or took it for granted they had power ſo to do. And ſo far it agrees with the former Council: and the ſame Anſwer will ſerve for both, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuppoſitions are no Articles of Faith. I am ſure nothing can be more evident in the world, then that either the common doctrine, of Divines, not excepting himſelf, muſt be chang'd, and we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to believe upon the credit of Councils, more then their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions: or there is no appearance of neceſſitating belief where there is no Definition.</p>
            <p>Thus much peradventure is more then needs be ſaid in the caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet, not to leave the Reader altogether ſo much in the dark as he does, let us conſider the matter over again. The <hi>Council of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> made a Decree concerning Depoſition; The <hi>Council of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> aſſented to an actual Depoſition; therefore they were both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, they, or the Pope, had power to depoſe. <hi>I,</hi> for my part,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53776:10"/> ſee not what more can be made of it. If this Gentleman be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-ſighted, he may, when he thinks fit, preſs it as he pleaſes; for indeed it belongs not to me to make his Argument for him. But taking it in this manner, which to my dulneſs gives it as much ſtrength as it will bear, let us ſee what force it has. Such a man as <hi>Launoy</hi> peradventure might be apt to make an exception which would not fall in every bodys way, and ſay, that whatever cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m may be made from theſe Preſidents in behalf of General Councils, or Popes, in and with them, there is no colour, from them, for Popes without them. I know not whether it might not prove troubleſom enough to ſhake off the importunity of him, who ſhould hang ſcrupulouſly upon ſuch a fancy. But I intend not to inſiſt on it my ſelf. For I know not that Councils pretend to the power of Depoſing; and though they ſhould, I ſhould think them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as thoſe who will obſtinately fix it on Popes.</p>
            <p>For the difficulty, I admit that both Councils were perſwaded that they had power to do what they did; and obſerve that they do not decree this perſwaſion of theirs to be true, bur ſomething to be done in conſequence of it. I obſerve again, that people may be perſwaded of the truth of things by motives of ſeveral kinds: by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from Faith alone, or Reaſon alone, or both together, by ſenſe, experience, and the reſt. I obſerve too, that from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good and ſincere man, may be gather'd his perſwaſion of the lawfulneſs of that action; but not the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ity of that perſwaſion, that is, whether it proceed from Faith, or ſcience, or any other way; no more then I can tell when I ſee a Tenant pay his Rent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have a Leaſe for years or lives. I obſerve farther, that who is truly perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of an action, may, and does without ſcruple, act in conſequence of that perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, which, I think, no body will queſtion, being put together, it remains to ſee what they will ſpell. The Antecedent is, <hi>Theſe Councils were perſwaded there was in the Church a depoſing power.</hi> The Concluſion which he would have follow is, <hi>Therefore the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Doctrine is of Faith.</hi> Another perhaps may infer, <hi>therefore the depoſing doctrine is true.</hi> I conceive there follows neither the one, nor the other.</p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt, I ſee not what can be clearer, then that if that perſwaſion of the Councils might proceed from any other ground, it cannot be concluded to have proceeded from Faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53776:11"/> ſomething more appear then the bare perſwaſion. If I ſhould go about to dilate the point, I fear the Reader would think I had a very bad opinion of his capacity. For 'tis in ſhort: of a thing which may be done many ways, we cannot tell which way it was done, purely by knowing that it was done; then which I think nothing can be more plain. I think t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o leſs plain, that the perſwaſion of thoſe who made up Councils, may proceed from other motives then Faith: becauſe men by ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing into Councils, do not leave their former judgments at the door, but carry them in, and ſpeak, and vote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, till by conference, or otherwiſe they come to alter them. That the judgments which they carry in with them are not all grounded on Faith, admits no diſpute. For we ſee it as plainly, and know it as certainly, as that they are men, and have judgments. This being ſo, I ſee not how it can be denyed but men in Councils may act upon Judgments which they brought along with them, and were grounded perhaps on other motives then Faith. Indeed when they decree any thing to be believed by the reſt of the world, or in the common language define it, without all queſtion, they take it for Faith themſelves. But this they have not done here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have neither laid any obligation on us to believe any thing, nor left us any colour of concluding, becauſe they proceeded according to their Judgements, that thoſe Judgments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proceeded from Faith, ſo much as in their own opinion.</p>
            <p>I need ſay no more to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is point, the bare poſſibility of the caſe being enough for my purpoſe. For no man <hi>I</hi> am ſure can convince it is thus, if it may be otherwiſe. But yet to carry it on a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I</hi> will add, that as far as we have means to gueſs at the ground, on which their Judgements were built, we have reaſon to think Faith was not that ground. For, as <hi>I</hi> obſerv'd formerly, to Faith, ſpeaking of Catholick Faith, there go two things. The point muſt have been in the firſt place originally reveal'd by Chriſt, and then preſerv'd by a conſtant and uninterrupted acknowledgement of Chriſtians. Of theſe two, the later, to Catholicks, is the proof of the former: they not doubting of any Article, which has been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally and uninterruptedly believ'd to have been reveal'd by Chriſt, but that it was in truth reveal'd by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Scripture indeed is an unqueſtioned, and unqueſtionable ground of Faith too. But it may happen that the ſence of Scripture may be controverted; as it falls out in the preſent diſpute: The <hi>Paſce oves</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53776:11"/> and <hi>Dabo claves,</hi> and the reſt, being differently underſtood by the different parties. Catholicks acknowledge no means of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a controverted ſence of Scripture with abſolute certainty, but the uniform and perpetual conſent of the Faithful underſtanding the controverted places in a determinate ſence, and witneſſing that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by practiſing accordingly. So that to them the ſence written in the hearts of the Faithful, and appearing in their actions, is the ſecurity even of the ſence of Scripture. This point to Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would ask more clearing; Catholicks <hi>I</hi> preſume will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it, and <hi>I</hi> ſpeak only to them. Wherefore, whether Scripture be inſiſted on or no, Tradition ſtill muſt warrant whatſoever can, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Catholicks, pretend to be a part of Catholick Faith. The whole ſtreſs then will lye in this, whether thoſe Councils were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they had this warrant, for their perſwaſions of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, whether they thought the generality of Chriſtians, in all times and places, did believe Chriſt had taught, or given depoſing power to the Pope. And <hi>I</hi> am much miſtaken, if he who will enter into the conſideration of this matter, will not finde reaſon to conclude it neither likely, nor indeed poſſible.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt place, if it could have been pretended, <hi>I</hi> do not ſee how it could happen that it was not, at ſome time or other. We ſee what was alledg'd in their behalf, and, by this Gentlemans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, we ſee it was not Tradition. The Councils indeed ſpeak not for themſelves, ſo that we have no light to guide us, but what breaks from Popes. And from them we ſee nothing but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to Binde and Looſe, to feed the ſheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in thoſe expreſſions of the Scripture, which by none of the Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them were ever interpreted in the ſence they put upon them. Of the writing foretold by the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. in the bowels and hearts of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, I</hi> ſinde no mention. Now whatever others ſay, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe no Catholick will think Scripture interpreted otherwiſe then for ten whole, and thoſe the firſt, Ages, was ever dreamt of, nay not only unatteſted, but contradicted by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice, any argument of Faith, nay not even though that interpretation ſhould happen to be true, if we ſpeak, as we do, of Catholick or to the generality obligatory Faith.</p>
            <p>To him indeed, who by his greater learning and greater diligence, ſhould with certainty diſcover the ſence of any place, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd before, that diſcovery would beget true Faith, as to his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53776:12"/> own particular, and as many more as by his or any means arriv'd to ſee as much as he. But this would concern no more then themſelves. The generality of Chriſtians would neither be oblig'd to examine whether they were miſtaken or no, nor to believe them without examination. And though the buſineſſe belong properly to Faith, yet it partakes much of the nature of Learning, obliging the aſſent of thoſe who ſee the truth, but none elſe ſo much as to look after it. But I begin to ſtray. What I inſiſt on is, that nothing has been produc'd, whereby it may be gathered, that the Councils alledged thought the depoſing doctrine atteſted, as a point of Faith ſhould be. Whence I conceive may be gathered, that no ſuch thing could be produced, and that they had no ſufficient motive to take it for a point of Faith, and therefore did not take it for ſuch.</p>
            <p>But not to rely on a negative proof, it is beyond diſpute evident, that all the Ages before <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th. were poſitively againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing doctrine. They taught unanimouſly, that ſoveraign Princes were ſubject only to God: and their crimes, if they committed any, to be judged by him alone. That the two ſupreme Powers were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and neither to meddle with the other; with a hundred ſuch things abſolutely incompatible with depoſing. No exception of Hereſy, or any other caſe was ever dreamt of, or though it had, could have been thought other then a dream; for no man awake, and in his wits could hope to make it conſiſtent with the then current doctrine. In their own time we are told it was diſputed and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined among Schollars. It was termed thruſting their ſickle into other mens harveſt. It ſcaped not the imputation of novelty, not to ſay hereſy. For my life I cannot ſee how he, who, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, will maintain, it was poſſible theſe Councils ſhould think <hi>Depoſing</hi> had always been believ'd by the Church, can avoid the rude irreverence of making them utterly ignorant how the world went not only before, but even in their days: unleſs, with a more unpardonable and more impoſſible injury, he make them force upon themſelves an aſſent to that, which they themſelves, and all the world beſides, knew to be falſe.</p>
            <p>Farther to look into the practice of former, and their own times, it is as clear, as that there were any ſuch times, that the caſe hapned more then once, wherein, had the doctrine been known, it had been very ſeaſonable to have come to Uſe and application. To paſs by the carriage of Chriſtians to Heathen Emperors, for the, I think,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53776:12"/> unreaſonable exception taken to it, it is known that ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of Chriſtianity there have been Emperors Apoſtates, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of ſeveral denominations, and Perſecutors: Who, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with erring themſelves, have employ'd all their induſtry and power to force thoſe errors upon their Subjects: who have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Churches from Catholicks, and given them to the favorite ſects; afflicted their perſons with impriſonment, baniſhment, death. And all this found nothing but patience and obedience from them. A zealous Prelat would now and then proceed ro Excommunication, and acknowledge and obey the excommunicate Prince when he, had done But there was the <hi>Non plus ultra.</hi> Knowledge of their own ſtrength, and the eaſy means they had to make reſiſtance, never tempted their ſubjects to reſiſt. In their own days, They ſaw there were ſoldiers to fight for depoſed Princes, Schollars to write for them, Biſhops to hold Councils, and preſerve the reputation of Religion to their party. Reconcile this who can with a perſwaſion in the cited Councils, that Depoſing was warranted by the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al practice of Chriſtians, who with their own eyes ſaw Chriſtians practiſing otherwiſe. Though the example of former times be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for our purpoſe. For they were inexcuſable for not putting this doctrine in practice in their circumſtances, if they knew it: and if they knew it not, it is undeniable that it could not come to after ages by ſucceſſion, the only way by which Faith can come.</p>
            <p>Again, who can think this doctrine was formerly held of Faith, when we ſee it is not ſo now? Of the Abbettors of it, few will ſtand ſteddily to it, that it is down right Faith: moſt plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it is not. Becauſe he ſhall ſay he has met with a fair Gameſter, I will put it even to this Gentleman himſelf, who for all his big words I verily believe is of the ſame minde. Not that I do ſo much as ſuſpect him of inſincerity, or that he ſpeaks not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his judgement when he ſays, and would prove his opinion, is of Faith. But I think this judgement of his, grounded on ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or perhaps prejudicate education, is contradicted by another grounded in nature, more deeply rooted, and a ſtronger principle of his actions. For truly I cannot think he would for any good communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, in holy things, with men, whom he takes for flat hereticks. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think he makes any difficulty to communicate thus with thoſe of the oppoſite way: for example, to receive or give Abſolution, or the Holy Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to, or from them. I ſuppoſe whatever he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53776:13"/> ſays, he acts in this manner without diſtinction between the one and the other as to theſe matters.</p>
            <p>But if he ſhould be more ſcrupulouſly nice, then I have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, I muſt tell him he would run away by himſelf, and ſet up a practice of Chriſtianity different from what is publickly own'd in the face of the Church. In <hi>France</hi> there are men of both perſwaſions; the one ſide findes the doors open at S. <hi>Louis,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and as they ſee fit perform the dutys of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in either place, none enquiring of them what they hold in this point. This the Church in <hi>France,</hi> and out of <hi>France,</hi> ſees and blames not. To go about with ſcrupulous noveltys to alter this ſetled cuſtom, would, I believe be lookt upon as little leſs then ſetting up Altar againſt Altar. However, while things are carried in this manner, while Churches, Confeſſion-ſeats, Altars, and whatever belongs to the exerciſe of Chriſtianity are free for this perſwaſion, he that will ſay, this perſwaſion is by the Church taken for Hereſy, muſt ſay that Hereſy is by the Church admitted to Communion in all the moſt holy things. And who will ſay, that though it paſs not in the Church for Hereſy, yet intruth it is ſo, muſt ſay, there is a point of Faith loſt, and the Church has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſomething taught her by Chriſt. Both which, if this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman think not inconvenient, I for my part think impoſſible.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that Card. <hi>Perron</hi> tells us, the Pope <hi>tolerates doctrine contrary to his own, for the good of the Churches peace.</hi> But then he muſt ſuppoſe the Pope does not take his own doctrine for Faith, otherwiſe he could not have made him a worſe complement. This is as much as to ſayl, that the Pope tolerates the caſting of the Churches pearl to ſwine; the proſtitution of the Sacraments, and whatever is moſt holy, to great, and unrepenting, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinners; (for ſuch the Cardinal, I ſuppoſe, takes Hereticks to be) ſuffers his ſheep to go aſtray, and, without regard to his paſtoral duty, freely to feed on the poyſonous herbs of Hereſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this for the good of the Church. As if any thing could be more contrary to the good of the Church, then to give the right hand of fellowſhip to Hereticks.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſo far from good, that 'tis moſt plainly ruinous to the Church. For when once Hereticks enter into her communion, ſhe ceaſes to be a company of Faithful. Neither indeed can Hereſy be tolerated in a Church; in a ſtate it may; and 'tis often expedient it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53776:13"/> ſhould. But that Church unchurches it ſelf which gives admittance to Hereſy, I mean ſo as to acknowledge for members thoſe who profeſs it: nor can there be a plainer contradiction in the world then that a man ſhould at once be an Heretick, and a Member of the Church, or an Heretick, and a not-Heretick. But the Cardinal underſtood the world better then to let theſe things be obtruded on the Pope, and ſo tells us preſently after, that, <hi>He is contented to hold his own opinion true, and the contrary erroneous, without binding us to hold his opinion neceſſary as matter of Faith, and the other Heretical.</hi> And therefore I think it but a reaſonable requeſt to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to allow us the ſame liberty the Pope does, and be contented with what contents the Pope. However I think I may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we have all the reaſon in the world to believe, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the Councils, imply'd in their proceedings, actually was framed on other grounds then Faith. (though, as I ſaid before, that be more then needs, it being ſufficient to my purpoſe that it might be ſo.) And conſequently that to infer from their perſwaſions, that what they were perſwaded of, was Faith to them, and ought be ſo to us, a very groundleſs, is, and very falſe inference.</p>
            <p>Let us now turn to the ſecond head, and conſider whether at leaſt it will not follow, that it was True. To make this conſequence good, <hi>They hold it,</hi> therefore <hi>it is true,</hi> it is evidently neceſſary to adde this univerſal, <hi>Whatſoever Councils hold is true,</hi> and becauſe Faith is ſet aſide, <hi>Whatever they hold, not by Faith, but Reaſon,</hi> by way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Definitions of Councils are obligatory; the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, even by themſelves, are not. This I think is plainly to ſay, that the firmneſs of their Definitions is to be refounded into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtronger then their diſcourſive facultys: and to acknowledge the Reaſons even of Councils, and judgements grounded on thoſe reaſons, in as much as they depend on them, may be faulty. Put it to the ſence of the Faithful, and we finde them expecting indeed from the providence of God, that Councils be exempt from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Faith, and manners flowing from it; but not in other things. And this is to ſay, that in our caſe, where Faith is excluded, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is believ'd. Wherefore he who will pretend we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to conform our aſſent to the perſwaſions of Councils, when thoſe perſwaſions are bred purely by diſcourſe, pretends we are oblig'd to take for true, what I think all the learned, and all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53776:14"/> Faithful of the Church are perſwaded may be otherwiſe. The truth is, when Councils leave their proper work Defining, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to Poſterity the Faith receiv'd from their Anceſtors, and fall to diſcourſing, or rather acting on diſcourſes formerly made, which is more properly our caſe, they are not in ſtrict formality, Councils. I mean in that propriety in which they are held to be infallible, but men aſſembled to be a Council, and proceeding now not as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but as ſo many men.</p>
            <p>Whatever be of that matter, becauſe in the way of diſcourſe there is no ſecurity againſt error, but ſcience, or ſeeing what p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be receiv'd for true, connected with ſome other foreknown Truth whether natural or reveal'd: and nature endures not we ſhould be oblig'd to receive for true, that of which we can have no ſecurity that it is ſo: this connexion of the perſwaſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils with ſome acknowledg'd Truth, muſt appear, before we can be oblig'd to own that perſwaſion for true. Had there been any, I ſuppoſe it would have been produc'd by ſome body, in ſo long time as this queſtion has been canvaſed in the world. In the mean time we have no reaſon, till it do appear, to believe there is any which can appear: and to urge us, before, to take their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions for true, is plainly to urge us to do, what we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do.</p>
            <p>That actually thoſe perſwaſions were not true, all thoſe muſt hold, who hold the depoſing doctrine falſe. And they have to ſay for themſelves, that it is a new doctrine begun in the 11th. age, againſt the doctrine and practice of ten Ages before: That it is oppoſite to the doctrine of Chriſt, who taught us that his Kingdom was not of this world; and by his Apoſtle that of neceſſity, we are to be ſubject to the temporal power, and this for conſcience, and that who reſiſt it procure their own damnation: That it confounds the two ſupreme and independent powers, and the obedience of their ſubjects, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it impoſſible to know how to carry themſelves, when thoſe powers claſh, and ſecure themſelves from falling either to God or <hi>Caſar:</hi> That with an impracticable and impoſſible project it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ets up one univerſal Monarch both in Spirituals and Temporals; of which inconvenience the verbal evaſions which are alledg'd, when they come to be fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted prove meerly verbal: with the reſt of what they urge, who appear for that way. As I am no farther concern'd then to anſwer the Argument in hand, <hi>viz. Councils proceeded on contrary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53776:14"/> perſwaſions;</hi> therefore <hi>that doctrine is falſe.</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf with ſaying, upon the warrant of the reaſons before alledg'd, that it is a weak and unconclvſive Argument, and that to ſtretch it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to engage Faith and the Church for that ſide, is much weaker.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the queſtion mov'd by the Author of the Preface to theſe Treatiſes, concerning <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> belongs to the <hi>Coancil of Lateran,</hi> I think it beſt, before I paſs farther, to gratify his deſire, but briefly, and as is proper for one who is about other buſineſs. For the difference he would ſee, betwixt the coming in of <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> and <hi>Depoſition:</hi> we hold the one came in with Chriſtianity, the other is not come in yet. And flatly deny what he aſſumes, that the ſame approbation of the Church is, or can be produc'd for both. For what he ſays, that they have the ſame Popes and Councils for them, I underſtand not what it can mean more, then the Authority of the Council, and the Pope who held it. And by what has been ſaid I conceive he will obſerve difference enough betwixt the two doctrines. The one was plainly defin'd, the other barely ſuppos'd. The Definition agreed with the Law written in the hearts of the Faithful: the ſuppoſition ſhockt it. And ſo the one was readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd: the other could never get quiet poſſeſſion. Beſides if he think Tranſubſtantiation has all its firmneſs from this Council, I beſeech him, in my turn, to reflect, how it happens, that 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by thoſe who perhaps never heard of the Council. Or if they did, do not value it, as having left communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> long before the Council was held. I beſeech him again to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this little: thinking it very improper to enter far into the Merits of ſuch a cauſe as Tranſubſtantiation, which deſerves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires exact handling, in a Treatiſe of another ſubject. To mingle ſuch diſparate matters is but to ſpoil both.</p>
            <p>The 5th. point which he will undertake to ſhew is, <hi>That all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Divines and Caſuiſts that have treated of it, from the firſt to the laſt (afore</hi> Calvins <hi>time) in all the ſeveral Nations of Chriſtendom, have aſſerted this power of the Pope, without ſo much as one contradicting it in all that time.</hi> This Topick, I muſt confeſs, frighted me. For what? Muſt a man be oblig'd to reade all the Divines and all the Caſuiſts of all the Nations in Chriſtendom before <hi>Calvin?</hi> Has this Gentleman who ſo confidently undertakes for all, read half of them? Can he anſwer there is a man in the world who has? If to ſee the truth of this allegation be neceſſary to the deciſion of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53776:15"/> the queſtion never will be decided. If it may be decided at all, it muſt be by ſome other means, and the allegation is plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell him 'tis impertinent on another ſcore. Divines and Caſuiſts are Schollars, men who undertake to prove what they ſay; and when their proof is good, what they ſay is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the ſake of that proof, not for theirs. For they may and do often miſtake, and are freely and irreprehenſibly contradicted every day. Wherefore let what he ſays be ſuppoſed true, which whether it be or no, neither he or any man elſe can tell: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before we have done, there will appear ſome reaſon to think it not true: but yet let it be allow'd, that all Divines, and all Caſuiſts, and all Canoniſts, whom he afterwards adds, have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted this doctrine: I ask whether in this great crowd, there be any one who has brought a convincing proof of what he ſays? If there be, let that proof be produc'd; for that alone will do the buſineſs. No matter who ſays it, or whether any beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ere thought of it. But if there be none, the thing remains ſtill unprov'd; for the ſayings of ten times as many more without proof, does not make proof.</p>
            <p>If this Gentleman think number ſignifys any thing in this caſe, it will concern him to teach us, how multitude gives authority to thoſe, who pretend to none but in virtue of their proofs, and which way many not-provers ſhould become provers.</p>
            <p>And when all is done, though he could produce this proof, (which if he thought he could, I ſuppoſe he would not ſend us to look for it where poſſibly 'tis not to be found) it would not be enough for his undertaking. For he takes upon him to prove his opinion to be Faith, and proof from Schollars, ſtretch it to the uttermoſt, will not reach farther then to prove it true, which a thing may be, and not be Faith neither. So that by the favour of this Gentlemans learning, this big ſounding Topick is wonderous ſlender in point of ſence: and when he has ſhewn it, he will only have ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> mighty well-read man in things, which deſerve not altogether ſuch pains.</p>
            <p>But how will he ſhew it too? For to my thinking, it is ſomething a difficult matter, to croud ſuch a number of Authors into the ſmall ſpace he has left of his ſhort Treatiſe. <hi>You may,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſee it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly prov'd by that admirable man</hi> Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perron <hi>in his Oration,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53776:15"/> Truly that ſpeech is ſomething longer then this writing; but yet Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> is an admirable man indeed, if he can make it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it were longer then it is, hold them all. But I obſerve it is with this Gentleman as with the generality of the world, among whom performances ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not altogether ſo large as promiſes. He undertakes for all Catholick Divines and Caſuiſts, and when he comes to make good this undertaking, theſe <hi>All</hi> ſhrink into ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Divines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas! was there no Divinity in the world; no skill in caſes and the Laws of the Church, before the School? Are the Fathers no body, or have they ſaid nothing relating to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Does it no way concern us, That <hi>the Clemency of God and tears of Chriſtians are their only remedy againſt Perſecutors?</hi> That <hi>to reſiſt otherwiſe then with tears and ſighs, Prieſts neither ought nor can.</hi> That <hi>Princes have none on Earth who may correct them:</hi> That <hi>Kings are free from the bonds of delinquency. That no laws puniſh them who are ſafe by the power of their Empire, and not accountable to men.</hi> That <hi>the ſpiritual Key extends not it ſelf to Temporals without arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</hi> That <hi>the Church has no power but ſpiritual:</hi> and that <hi>to quick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n not kill.</hi> That <hi>the Biſhop has no power to meddle with the Palace, and Regal dignity.</hi> That Popes, holy and wiſe and great Popes profeſt <hi>they ought obedience to Emperors, and were ſubject to their commands.</hi> This was doctrine taught in the Church before <hi>Calvin,</hi> by thoſe who paſt for Divines in their days, and if this Gentleman would but give them his good word, I think might do ſo ſtill. And this doctrine being evidently irreconcilable with a power in the Pope, which extends to temporals, corrects Princes with temporal penaltys, cauſes them to be reſiſted by violence and Arms, <hi>in fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with depoſing doctrine: it is evidently undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that ſome Catholick Divines have not aſſerted that power of the Pope.</p>
            <p>However becauſe he ſays the Cardinal has prov'd the contrary, we will wait on the Cardinal, if only for the curioſity of ſeeing an impoſſible thing once come to paſs. There the proof dwindles again, into thoſe of his own Nation. Of theſe he names half a dozen, who, he ſays, have more exalted the Popes power, and whoſe words he therefore forbears to cite. And 'tis very likely that more then ſix have exalted the Popes power above what is fitting. Thoſe whoſe words he quotes, are S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> (reckoning him among the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe he ſtudyed and wrote in <hi>France,) Occam, John of Paris,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fidel Princes deſerve to loſe their dominion. Which is ſufficiently canvaſt betwixt <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the two <hi>Barclays;</hi> to whom they may reſort, whoſe curioſity will carry them ſo far. It ſeems odd enough, to make Demerit in them a premiſe to infer Power in the Pope: nor can I imagine which way they will be joyn'd together. Since St. <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf has not connected them, I conceive it belongs to him to do it, who expects this authority ſhould work upon us. Of the 2d. I ſee no reaſon at all, ſave that 'tis inſinuated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Apoſtacy may do a great deal of harm. But how that harm ſhould make a ſpiritual cenſure have a temporal effect, neither S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays, nor any body I think can underſtand.

            <p>The next is <hi>Occam,</hi> who ſays the Pope cannot ordinarily depoſe Emperors or Kings, <hi>if his fault be not of the number of ſpiritual crimes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 8. queſt. q. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For he declares he will not diſcover what he held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but only ſo relate what is alledged on both ſides, as to conceal to which he adhears. And ſo gives the words cited for an anſwer which ſome make to an objection urged in behalf of the Pope; but tells us in the ſame place, that there are others who ſay, the Popes who depoſed the Emperors, <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Frederic,</hi> did amiſs; uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a power which they had not. And elſewhere he ſays, there is,<note place="margin">Dial. p. 3. Tract. 1. c. 13. 16.</note> among divers others, one opinion which gives the Pope a plenitude of power, that is of doing whatever is not contrary to the law of God and nature, and this by Devine Right; according to which he may depoſe Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not regularly, but on occaſion, <hi>Caſualiter,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53776:16"/> as he calls it. But he ſays too, there is another, which denys the Pope has any ſuch power, whether by Divine or Humane right, whether regularly or caſually. So that by the Cardinals favour, it is manifeſt out of this Author, whom he produces for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that there were before <hi>Calvins</hi> time, Divines who, without any exception of Hereſy, or the like, flatly deny'd the depoſing power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John of Paris</hi> is cited in this manner: <hi>If a Prince were an Heretick and incorrigible, and a contemner of the Churches cenſure, the Pope might do ſomething in the behalf of</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>In,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong,</hi> or <hi>with) the people: whereof might enſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For then a remembrance muſt be had of the laſt clauſe of this Conſideration; that in theſe caſes the power Eccleſiaſtick hath a certain dominion regitive, directive, regulative, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> Truly this is not ſo much, as, I am perſwaded will freely be allowed. The Anti-Depoſers, foraſmuch as I can gather by their writings, will not boggle at a <hi>Coercive</hi> too, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived it keep within its proper bound, of ſpirituality. I think they make no doubt but if a Lay-man, whether private man or Prince, do any thing contrary to the Law of God, the Eccleſiaſtical power may, nay, ought direct, and regulate, and order, and govern this man according to that Law, (which is all that <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſays here,) and alſo by ſeperating him from the communion of the ſaithful, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the benefits of the Church, compell him. But they do not think the temporal goods, which he abuſes, may therefore be taken from him by the Eccleſiaſtical power. This <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſays not. On the contrary in his 4th. Conſideration, he delivers his opinion for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, in the modeſt way of intitling it to others. <hi>There are</hi> ſays he, <hi>who ſay that this (viz.</hi> Excommunication) <hi>is the laſt penalty which the Eccleſiaſticai power of Jurisdiction can inflict by the ſole primary inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt:</hi> what they do more, as when they impriſon, or puniſh corporally, being by the conceſſion of Princes.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Divines, whoſe words are produc'd by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal. Whereof four flatly ſay the contrary of what he pretends, and 5th. ſpeaks on both ſides, but with a good reaſon when he is againſt him, and none when he is for him. And this is the abundant proof of all Divines, and all Nations which this Gentleman promiſed. There
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53776:17"/> are beſides 2 or 3 Canoniſts alledg'd, with whom I will have nothing to do, becauſe I think they have not much to do with the buſineſs. They are to tell us what the Pope has commanded. What power he has to command I conceive we are to learn of ſome body elſe. And ſo much for the abundant proof.</p>
            <p>But there is beſides, as he ſays, a convincing one. And that is, that neither <hi>Withrington,</hi> nor any body elſe, <hi>before</hi> Calvin, <hi>has been able to produce ſo much as one Catholick Author that deny'd this power in the Pope abſolutely, or in any caſe whatſoever.</hi> If this be true, they are the more beholding to Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> who has produc'd ſuch Authors for them. But have not they produc'd them too? Have they not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded others, who ſay, that whether the Pope can depoſe an Emperor (without exception of Hereſy or other caſe) is a queſtion debated among ſchollers, and undetermined: That 'tis a novelty not to ſay hereſy: That if theſe depoſitions of Kings and Emperors, Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Empire and the reſt, ſhould move the Pope to do the like, he muſt know, if Religion and Humility would permit, they might all be truly and moſt cleerly anſwer'd. Have they not brought others who teach doctrine abſolutely inconſiſtent with his Tenet; as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of the two powers, the confinement of the Eccleſiaſtical to ſpiritual matters, the ſubjection of Princes to God alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he will ſay theſe determine not the queſtion, becauſe they ſpeak not particularly of the Pope, &amp; depoſing, &amp; Hereſy, he may as rationally ſay, that nothing was taught contrary to Arianiſm before the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> becauſe the word <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> was then firſt uſed. In ſhort, this is to ſay, there is no meat on the board, becauſe it is not ſerv'd up as he would have it. And if this Argument convince any thing, it is, that he has taken little heed to what has been ſaid on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>The 6th and laſt head is, that <hi>all Catholick Emperors, Kings (yea even they who were depoſed) States, Magiſtrates, and Lawyers, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, all the Catholicks in the world, for the time being, have (by tacit conſent at leaſt) approv'd and receav'd this Doctrine of Popes, Divines, and Caſuiſts, and theſe Cenſures, Canons, and Practiſes of Popes and general Councils.</hi> Magnificently ſaid! Why what a glorious noiſe does this approbation of the whole world make? How do you ſhew this, I beſeech you? for this is worth ſeeing. Have you National Acts of all the Countrys in Chriſtendom to produce, wherein theſe doctrines and practiſes are approv'd and receiv'd? On the contrary, are there not ſome Catholicks, and ſome Magiſtrates, who to your knowledge do not approve and receive them, and whom you call
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53776:18"/> wicked Catholicks, and in damnable error for their pains? I pray, Sir, let us ſee your proof. Truly you muſt excuſe him for that matter. It is too ſevere to expect the performance of impoſſibilitys. And ſo he never ſo much as goes about to bring any proof at all of this big un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. The terrible cloud, which threatens the approbation of all the world, vaniſhes at laſt into the thin imperceptible miſt of <hi>tacit conſent.</hi> And ſo much if you will allow him, why ſo. If not, you may let it alone as he does: for he takes no more care about that neither, then barely to ſay it.</p>
            <p>Now I would fain know what this <hi>tacit conſent</hi> means. The world, as it muſt always happen, was on thoſe occaſions divided into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and Unconcern'd People who were unconcern'd did then, as they always did, and always will do, look on, and ſee what's paſt, and minde their own buſineſs, and let others do what they think fit in theirs. May this be what he calls <hi>tacit conſent?</hi> If their acting, or rather not acting, in this manner ſignify their conſent, plainly they conſented to both ſides, to what was done againſt, as well as what was done for the Pope. Beſides I have not heard ſilence interpreted for conſent, unleſs where perſons are concern'd to ſpeak; and then if they hold their tongues, they may be thought to like that, of which they ſhew no diſlike. Otherwiſe ſilence may be an Argument of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern, but none of conſent.</p>
            <p>For the Concern'd, though he have diſcover'd the gift he has of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence more then once. yet I cannot but wonder to ſee it could carry him to make them, too, of the party, and all, and always, the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Princes themſelves and all. May we in earneſt rely upon it? For methinks 'tis ſtrange, that all depoſed Princes ſhould ſubmit quietly, without making any buſtle; and the world hear no more on't. Was there never any oppoſition, no complaints in words, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe complaints by deeds? To bid like a fair Chapman, can he name the ſingle Prince, for whoſe <hi>tacit conſent</hi> he can ſo undertake, as to perform when he has done? This I am ſure, that the two he names, <hi>Frederick the 2d</hi> and <hi>Henry the 4th,</hi> were not altogether ſo meek. The firſt kept his Empire, in ſpite of all oppoſition, till his death, and in the mean time afflicted the Pope, and his partakers, with calamities which made him weary of his Life. The other made a woful buſtle for many years, overcame divers of the Competitors ſet up againſt him, and held good till his own ſon, as he complains, ſhamefully betray'd him, and forc't him to reſign. And after all, was in a fair way of recovering all again, when death put an end to his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53776:18"/> life, and the quarrel together, the only end which the buſineſs had.</p>
            <p>Saving his better judgement, I ſhould think theſe things made ſome noiſe, and cannot very properly be term'd <hi>tacit,</hi> nor <hi>conſent,</hi> nor <hi>approbation</hi> neither, unleſs Enemies be ſaid to approve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers quarrel, who are together by the ears about it. I ſhould think too that theſe two Princes could not make all this buſtle alone, and that they had ſome, and a great many, who took their parts, and that ſtrongly and conſtantly; and that theſe were Catholicks, unleſs it be ſhewn of what Hereſy they were guilty. For as for the <hi>Henrician</hi> Hereſy, then coyn'd to reproach them with, it ſignifys no more then oppoſers of the Pope. And the queſtion being whether thoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers were Catholick, it is to beg it, to ſay they were not, but <hi>Henrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> or in other words, the oppoſers were not Catholicks, but oppoſers.</p>
            <p>Their actions therefore plainly ſhew little conſent. Let us hear their words. He tells us. p. 11 that the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> never excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſentence againſt him, as given <hi>a non Judice.</hi> I cannot tell which fail'd him, his Information, or his memory; but one was much too blame. By his often citing <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> I ſhould gueſs he had read him. And 'tis ſtrange he ſhould forget what the Emperor writes in a letter to the Prelats and Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> ſet down in the year 1646. The words are theſe, <hi>Conſiderent etiam,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Conſider alſo what Juſtice is to be reputed in the proceſs iſſued out againſt us: or by what name it muſt go, if it may be call'd a ſentence which is publiſht by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Judge. For although at the ſuggeſtion of our Catholick Faith, according to our duty, we do openly confeſs, that a full power in ſpirituals is given by God to the Biſhop of the Roman See, how great a ſinner ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (which God forbid) he be, ſo that what he bindes on Earth is bound in Heaven, and what he looſens is looſed; yet it is no where read, that it is granted to him by Divine or humane Law, that he may at his pleaſure transfer Empires, or judge of temporally puniſhing the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Earth by depoſing them from their Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in his letter to the King the year before, <hi>Quid enim vobis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For what is not every particular King of his particular Kingdom to fear from the face of ſuch a Prince of the Prieſthood? if we both by ſolemn Election of the Princes, and approbation of the whole Church, while it flouriſht with the Faith and Religion of the Clergy, honoured from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Imperial crown, and magnificently governing other noble Kingdoms, be attempted to be depoſed by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom it concerns not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any ſeverity upon us, as to damage in Temporals, although juſt cauſes were made out. But we are neither the firſt nor the laſt, whom the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53776:19"/> abuſe of ſacer dotal power does thus moleſt, and endeavor to throw down from the top to the bottom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another letter to the French, he ſpeaks thus: <hi>Cum per aliquot,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ap. Jo. Barcl. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finc Lib.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe we do with good reaſon hold our ſelves, and other Kings, Princes of the world, and Noblemen having Kingdoms, Principalities, honours of whatever kinde, and Juriſdiction, agriev'd by ſome preceding and the preſent Biſhop of the Roman See, in this, That They, contrary to God and Juſtice uſurp to themſelves a power, Juriſdiction, and Authority to ſet up Emperors, Kings and Princes, or whatſoever Potentates, and pulling down, or removing them from their Empire, Kingdoms, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitys, and Honours, exerciſing temporal Authority temporally over them, abſolving alſo Vaſſals from the Oaths by which they are ty'd to their Lords, only by promulgating the ſentence of Excommnnication againſt thoſe Lords,</hi> &amp;c. I forbear to enquire how it hapned, that he could ſo much miſtake in what he ſays of this Emperor. But I think that 'tis very plain he did miſtake, and that this Emperor ſpeaks too loudly and poſitively to paſs for a <hi>tacit Conſenter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. delivers his ſentiments in the letter formerly cited by this Gentleman. <hi>Sed Tu,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But you took our humility for fear, And therefore have not fear'd to riſe up againſt the very Regal power granted us by God, which you have dared to threaten to take away from us, as if we had received our Kingdom from you: as if Kingdoms and Empires were in your, and not in Gods hand,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>But what ſays the true Pope</hi> St. Peter? <hi>Fear God, Honour the King. But you, becauſe you do not fear God, have diſhonour'd me his ſubſtitute. Whence</hi> St. Paul <hi>where he ſpares not an Angel from Heaven if he preach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, has not excepted you teaching otherwiſe on Earth. For he ſays: If any, whether I, or an Angel from Heaven Evangelize to you otherwiſe then we have Evangeliz'd, let him be</hi> Anathema. <hi>You then condemn'd by this Anathema, and the judgment of all our Biſhops, deſcend,</hi> &amp;c. What think you Sir? does he tacitly conſent to that Popes doctrine and proceedings, who tells him, that his attempt upon Regal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, incurr'd the Anathema of the Apoſtle? It ſhould ſeem too there were Biſhops alſo, more then one, who concurr'd with him in theſe ſentiments, and conſented no more then He.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t enim. For to mention a few things of many: He has uſurpt to himſelf, without the privity of God, both Kingdom and Prieſthood. In which he has contemn'd the pious ordination of God, who would have the two, that is the Kingdom and Prieſthood, conſiſt principally in two,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53776:19"/> not in one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He has ſtudy'd alſo to deprive me, whom God call'd to the Kingdom, not him to the Prieſthood, of my Kingdom, becauſe he ſaw I would hold it from God, not from him, becauſe he made me not King, threatning to take from me both Kingdom and life, whereof he gave neither.</hi> This too in my opinion ſounds nothing like conſent. It is plain he diſſented, and diſſented on thoſe grounds which move others to diſſent now, <hi>viz.</hi> the disjunction and Independency of the two ſupreme powers, taught by the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hers.</p>
            <p>I will adde a paſſage out of the nameleſs Author, who writes, this Emperors life, a friend indeed to him, but no enemy to the Pope. Having ſaid, the Pope, ſurreptitioufly deluded, by the crimes ſaign'd againſt him, and the honour of creating a King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully offer'd him, excommunicated the King, and abſolv'd his ſubjects from the Oath which they had taken to him: He adds, <hi>which Fact diſpleaſed many (if it be lawful to be diſpleas'd at what the Pope does) and they affirmed that what was done, was done both inefficaciouſly, and unlawfully. But I dare not ſet down their aſſertions, leſt I ſeem with them to condemn the Popes doings.</hi> By this again it appears, that there were diſapprovers, and many, in thoſe days, as well as now. And it appears too why they make no more noiſe. People were ſhy to cenſure the actions of Popes. And ſo they are ſtill. And I hope it will be no imputation upon Catholicks, that Inferiors are poſſeſt with reſpect for their Superiors.</p>
            <p>In the latter conteſts betwixt the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and his contemporary Popes, the world was ſtill the ſame. There is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> an Information, in behalf of the Emperor againſt the Pope, which alledges ſeveral reaſons for the nullity of the Popes proceedings. The firſt is, <hi>The Pope, however Catholick and lawful he be, has not power, nor authority, or Jurisdiction in Temporals, and chiefly over the rights of the Empire, which is immediately from God.</hi> Again, <hi>whence alſo appears, that theſe ſentences were pron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53776:20"/> hearken to none, who are aſperſed with that reproach on the one ſide, or the other, perhaps there will remain no body to give us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation what paſt in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>This Emperor was contemporary with <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. of <hi>England.</hi> What has hapned, of this nature, ſince that time, is pretty freſh in our memories, and needs not be lookt for in books. By what is ſaid, I think we may ſafely conclude, the world was then, as now, divided into Approvers, and Diſapprovers of Depoſing doctrine: and that there was no time in which there were not Diſapprovers, ſave when there were no Approvers. For I think it ſomething a harder task to ſhew, that Depoſing doctrine has always been in the world, then that it was not conteſted, when it did appear. And yet that is ſo hard, that this Gentleman, as confidently as he undertakes it, has not brought one ſingle word to prove it: and we have ſeen plain enough why he could not.</p>
            <p>There remains the Concluſion, in which aſſuming, in confidence of his proofs, that his doctrine has been, (for one Age at leaſt) the Doctrine of the Church, he infers; If it be an Error the Church was at that time a wicked Church; if otherwiſe, thoſe are wicked men who oppoſe it. I have given my reaſons why I conceive his proofs will not bear him out, to fix his Doctrine on the Church. 'Tis the Readers right to judge between us: and to him I leave it.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe I ſhould ſay, that ſince the Church is a Congregation of Faithful, and Faithful are men, that word <hi>Church</hi> may ſignify ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Faithful, or the men. Suppoſe too that all the men of the Church, ſhould at ſome time, have held his doctrine, which is a great deal more then can be prov'd, becauſe indeed it is not true; but yet ſuppoſe it. If he will infer from this ſuppoſition, the Church held it, the word <hi>Church,</hi> to make his inference true, muſt be taken materially, in the latter ſence. Otherwiſe, according to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick method, the men of the Church bear not the denomination of a Church, but where they hold from Chriſt, un-interrupted Tradition. And till he make it appear they hold his doctrine in this manner, they may hold it as long as they will, and as many as they will, and not hold it as Faithful, but as Schollars, or how you will.</p>
            <p>If he infer farther, the Church held it, therefore the Church was a wicked Church: becauſe Church, unleſs the contrary be declared, is underſtood in the firſt ſence, formally: The Argument is a plain Sophiſm, taking the word Church in a different ſignification, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially in the Antecedent, formally in the Concluſion.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53776:20"/>
            <p>But will it follow at leaſt, that all the men of the Church were, in that ſuppoſition, wicked, and in damnable error? Firſt, I ſhould think this is no ſuch ruinous inconvenience, though it were admitted. For ſince <hi>All,</hi> in this caſe, can ſignify no more then thoſe <hi>All,</hi> who concern'd themſelves in the queſtion, which the far greateſt part of Catholick mankinde cannot rationally be thought to have done; though <hi>All</hi> theſe were damned, there would ſtill remain enough, in whoſe ſalvation the perpetual goodneſs of God, and care of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would ſufficiently appear.</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot think that even ſo much would follow. They would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be in error; neither has God promis'd any ſecurity againſt it, but in his doctrine, &amp; the voice of the Church to tell us which it is. If men will go otherways, it is at their own peril. But I ſee no neceſſity, that this Error ſhould damn, or fix the name of wicked upon them. To be deceiv'd in ſpeculation, &amp; act upon a deceiv'd, ſo it be a ſincere judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have not heard has undergon theſe harſh cenſurs in other caſes</p>
            <p>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but 'tis a damnable ſin to withſtand the rights of Princes; to be the occaſion of war, and Bloudſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To withſtand indeed is damnable; but I do not underſtand it is ſo to miſtake them. Likewiſe to make an unjuſt war is damnable, but if it be thought juſt, though falſly, yet uprightly, ſure there is hope of mercy, or more Chriſtians are in a damnable ſtate upon this account, then for denying the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doctrine. Alas! The Rights, even of Princes are not things fixt by the eternal law of God, in an Indiviſible point, beyond which if a man happen to tread, he ſtumbles irrecoverobly into Hell. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on humane conſtitutions, and are greater here, leſs there, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent every where. They may be, and every day are miſtaken, and Princes proſecute theſe miſtakes (for when they differ, they cannot both be in the right) by Arms. Yet if their own conſcience condemn them not, no body elſe does that I know. Churchmen may miſtake them as will as others. They having no priviledge, that I know, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from error, but by ſticking to the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when they do miſtake, I ſee not why they are more wicked, or their errors more concern the Church then thoſe of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in the ſame caſe. But this I only think by the by, to ſhew there are more ways to the wood then one, if there were occaſion, and that I took his, more by choice than neceſſity. I thought it needleſs to beat out a new path while there lay one plain and eaſy before me. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53776:21"/> his opinion was never univerſal at any time. The quarrel, for the moſt part, was betwixt Pope and Emperor. Italians and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſided part with one, part with the other. Not Armys only, but Councels too, were on both ſides. Who thinks in the choice of partys, they were all guided purely by conſcience, I doubt has little obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Hiſtorys of thoſe times: in which, beſides other things, we finde they frepuently chang'd ſides, as their Intereſt led them. Other Nations lookt unconcernedly on, till it came to their own doors; and then they did as much as they thought expedient, not always all they thought lawful. And ſo it remains at this day, when People act not, till occaſion prompt them, and then are guided in their Actions by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience. In the mean time, for reverence to the Pope, private men according to the example of their Anceſtors, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey think contrary to what the Pope does, are willing to keep their thoughts to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And that is the reaſon, as I conceive, of that ſilence, from whence he takes occaſion to infer a <hi>tacit conſent.</hi>

            <p>To take leave of this Gentleman and his Argument at laſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven accounts at parting: ſix of his ten proofs, that is more then half of the whole, belong to the Head of the Pope, which would have been granted without one, and when it is ſo, does not do the buſineſs, I think, even in his own Judgement. Three more, whereof one I thought needleſs to take notice of, belong to the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> which how he would apply, he leaves us to gueſs. The remaining one ſends us to <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> where how we ſpeed, you have heard. And for his 6th. Head, which ſounds ſo big, there is no proof at all. And this is the ſum total of his performance.</p>
            <p>The Argument is borrow'd from <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> where it ſhews a great deal better, dreſt up in the ornaments of Rhetorick, then ſtript and expoſ'd naked, as his Logick preſents it.

Whether <hi>Depoſing</hi> be <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> being very different from, <hi>Whether the Oath of Allegiance may be taken.</hi> This Gentleman declines the firſt, ſaying it is <hi>as far from his thoughts, as forreign to his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>purpoſe.</hi> In which I muſt at the very firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from him. For I conceive that all elſe is forreign to this purpoſe. But it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly forreign to both our Purpoſes, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Reader, to detain him long with uſeleſs Preambles, I think it beſt, without more ado, to fall to the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt Chapter is ſpent in ſtating the Queſtion, which he ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly<note place="margin">I.</note> puts us in mind is not, <hi>Whether a Catholick may deny,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Popes Power to depoſe Princes,</hi> but <hi>Whether he may deny,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by Oath, and univerſally abjure it?</hi> To deny, and to deny by Oath, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed different things: but yet in this caſe, <hi>not to deny by Oath,</hi> I ſuſpect will be thought to amount to, <hi>not to deny.</hi> It is true, in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53776:22"/> converſation, we often ſay what we would be loath to ſwear. We ſpeak unadvertingly, on ſlight ſurmiſes, or idle hear-ſays, and are ſo underſtood. If we ſay what proves falſe, none lays more than lightneſs to our charge. For indeed Man would be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſociable Animal, if in Company nothing could be utter'd but Demonſtration. But if we be urged to <hi>ſwear</hi> what we ſay, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, that refuſal is a plain unſaying it; nor will any man believe what we ſay, or think we expect to be believ'd. Except <hi>Quakers,</hi> no honeſt man ever refus'd to ſwear what he ſeriouſly and ſteadily perſiſts to ſay, in a matter of importance, and where his Oath is duly requir'd. I mean according as he deliberately ſays; that is, if he ſay he knows, or thinks, or has heard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will ſwear he knows it, that is poſitively, or thinks, or has heard it. For ſince an Oath is the aſſurance we give, that we ſpeak according to our conſcience, who will not give that aſſurance, had as good ſay, he ſpeaks againſt his conſcience. At leaſt People will be apt to ſuſpect ſo: and not altogether without ground, if they cannnot be aſſur'd of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Now when he makes the ſtate of the Queſtion conſiſt, in <hi>denying by Oath,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means in that manner in which the Oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the denial ſhould be made. That is, as the Oath explains it ſelf, according to the plain and common ſence of the words. Taking which conſideration along with us, I think we ſhall not fall out about the ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>In the next Chapter he begins to argue, and from the authority of <hi>Trithemius,</hi> and Experience, aſſumes firſt, <hi>that the point has been long, and ſtill is under debate, and may be ſo, for ought we know, 500. years hence.</hi> This is both undeniably true, and withal a full anſwer to the former Treatiſe. For if this Queſtion has been diſputed among <hi>Catholicks,</hi> theſe 500 years, and may be 500 more, I hope none will ſay it belongs to Faith, but he, who has a mind to give thoſe who are of different Perſwaſions in Religion, the ſatisfaction of ſeeing it confeſt by our ſelves, that we have not of a long time been agreed about matters of Faith, and in all likelihood never ſhall.</p>
               <p>He proceeds in this manner: <hi>Since likewiſe, when a point is thus in diſpute among Catholick Princes</hi> (by the way, that <hi>Princes</hi> I take to be an errour of the Preſs, becauſe he began with <hi>Scholars,</hi> and if he do not continue on with them, the diſcourſe is not conſtant to it ſelf) <hi>no one can determinately ſwear to either ſide of the point in diſpute, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53776:22"/> true,</hi> &amp;c. I marry! this will do it, if it be true. If no point in diſpute can be ſworn, this of the Pope's Power undoubtedly cannot. I hope he will bring very good proof of this Univerſal, both becauſe all the ſtreſs lyes upon it, and becauſe indeed it ſounds ſomething like a Paradox. For few things at this rate will remain, which may be ſworn in the World, where almoſt every thing is in diſpute. Beſides, 'tis a clear caſe, that one of the Contradictories is true, and I know not why ſome body may not ſee that truth. And 'twould be ſtrange, if he who ſees the truth, may not ſwear, becauſe, who ſees it not continues to diſpute. As clear as it is, that the Queſtion is diſputed betwixt the diſagreeing parties, it is no leſs clear, that it is not diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among thoſe who are agreed. Muſt their conduct depend on the good pleaſure of the other? Muſt they ask thoſe others leave to ſay, or ſwear, what they think themſelves? and not take the liberty till all the World think as they do?</p>
               <p>This ſeems very ſtrange. But yet becauſe ſtrange things now and then come to paſs, it is not reaſonable his proof ſhould fare e're the worſe for being unexpected, provided it be good. This it is: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this were to ſwear a thing as true, or to abjure it as falſe, which is confeſſedly in diſpute whether it be ſo or no, which is never lawful.</hi> How, Sir! never lawful? pray let us conſider a little. The propoſition to be prov'd was this: <hi>No point in diſpute can be ſworn.</hi> The proof is, <hi>It is never lawful to ſwear a point in diſpute.</hi> Why this is ſaying the ſame thing in different words, For, <hi>It is not lawful to ſwear,</hi> and <hi>we cannot ſwear,</hi> ſignifie the ſame. This is not a reaſon, but a repetition. When I demanded proof of a propoſition which ſeemed ſtrange, I deſir'd to know, why we could not ſwear a diſputed point, that is, why it is not lawful ſo to do. The ſatisfaction he gives me is, that 'tis never lawful. Which is to ſay, It is not lawful, becauſe it is not lawful. I ſuſpect few will be ſatisfi'd with ſuch a proof, and that whoſoever thinks the firſt propoſition falſe, will very hardly be brought to think it a jot the truer, for being otherwiſe worded; <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> only chang'd into, <hi>'Tis not lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence,</hi> he conceives, <hi>that for the deciding our Queſtion, there needs no other than barely to ſuppoſe it is a Queſtion. For if it be a Queſtion whether the Pope hath ſuch Power, no man can ſafely ſwear that without all queſtion he has none.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Without all queſtion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what we ſwear as true, ought to be unqueſtionably ſuch, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we fall under the guilt and ſacrilege of Perjury.</hi> The art of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53776:23"/> off things to advantage, does well in all Trades. This chimes a little more pleaſantly, but 'tis the ſame Tune ſtill. <hi>Hence</hi> ſignifies, <hi>from having ſaid twice over one of the premiſes,</hi> viz. that <hi>we cannot lawfully, or ſafely ſwear,</hi> he makes it follow, at laſt, that <hi>we cannot ſafely ſwear.</hi> The reſt is the beauty of a Rhetorical Figure, to make it ſhew more handſomly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We cannot ſwear, The Pope without all queſtion has no Power, if it be a queſtion, whether he have or no.</hi> True: but whoever went about, or was requir'd to ſwear, that there is no queſtion made in the World of the Pope's Power? Does he in earneſt think thoſe he oppoſes, of ſuch loſt Conſciences, that they would ſwear this? Or Proteſtants ſo unreaſonable to exact it? They who know altogether as well as we, for they have the ſame Books to inform them, that there is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and who made the Oath of Allegiance for this very reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew there was one, and deſir'd to know what we held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
               <p>But he ſays <hi>without all queſtion, becauſe what we ſwear as true, ought to be unqueſtionably ſuch.</hi> I have already ſaid that there is no queſtion among thoſe who are agreed of it. What they ſwear is to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. Nor do I think any can ſwear, who queſtions or doubts the truth of what he ſwears. But if he think a man, who is ſatisfi'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot ſwear, becauſe another man is not, he muſt prove it, if he will have it granted. This is the knot of the buſineſs; towards the looſing of which I do not find it contributes any thing, to ſay <hi>It is a point in queſtion,</hi> more than, as he ſaid before, that <hi>'tis a point in diſpute.</hi> So that as far as I ſee, we are e'en juſt where we were.</p>
               <p>For a more full evidence, He falls to diſcourſe of the nature of Oaths, and concludes very truly, That to ſpeak contrary to what a man thinks in his Conſcience, is a <hi>Lye,</hi> and to ſwear ſo, <hi>Perjury.</hi> This contrariety, or contradiction, he ſays, may happen two wayes. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>knowing, or being conſcious, that what we ſwear is not true:</hi> or by <hi>not knowing, and therefore doubting, or having juſt cauſe to doubt whether it be true or no.</hi> And this is alſo true. Only I take him to mean that this <hi>not knowing,</hi> and <hi>doubting,</hi> and <hi>having juſt cauſe to doubt,</hi> muſt be in the Conſcience of him who can be perjur'd by them. And for <hi>Doubting,</hi> that indeed can hardly be out of it. For no man, I think, can doubt, and not know that he does ſo. But we ſee it often happen, that he who knows not, takes himſelf to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53776:23"/> know, and that he who has cauſe enough to doubt, for all that, does not doubt. Let this man ſwear what he thinks he knows, but does not, and what he has juſt cauſe to doubt of, but is not aware of it: I gather from this Gentlemans Doctrine, that whether what he ſwear be true or falſe (which alters not the caſe) he is not perjur'd, becauſe he does not contradict his conſcience, and has no ſecret checks, and inward proteſtations againſt his Action. Whether he ſin or no, is another queſtion, to enter into which, were to go out of our way at preſent: in likelihood we ſhall meet with it again: But according to this Gentleman, it is not the ſin of Perjury. Otherwiſe his two ways of Perjury, or contradicting the conſcience, would be, one by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting, and the other by not contradicting it. But, I ſuppoſe, we both mean the ſame. What uſe he will make of this full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we muſt expect from what follows, this being all he ſays here.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THe next Chapter tells us, that ſwearing according to the beſt of the ſwearers knowledge, will not ſerve turn: and that <hi>we muſt remember no leſs is requir'd, than to ſwear according to a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. And this is neatly ſet off with a wiſh, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> may ſignifie <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that the <hi>beſt of his knowledge</hi> may not prove the <hi>beſt of his no-knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. As ignorant as I am my ſelf, I yet think ſo well of Knowledge, that I am glad to ſee ſomebody ſtand up for her: and heartily wiſh as he does, that only Knowledge may paſs for Knowledge, and her name and eſteem not to be abus'd and uſurp'd wrongfully.</p>
               <p>But I deſire to know who it is that is thus ſevere, and requires no leſs than true Knowledge in our caſe? Whether it be the nature of the thing, ſo that ſeverely true Knowledge be a neceſſary and indiſpenſable condition in all Oaths? or whether Proteſtants do particularly require it to the Oath oſ Allegiance?</p>
               <p>If he ſay the firſt, I doubt he, who is ſo careful to bid us remember, has himſelf forgot what he ſaid but juſt before. The formal notion and malice of Perjury, in the laſt Chapter, conſiſted in ſwearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the inward dictates of Conſcience. And 'tis beyond diſpute,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53776:24"/> that thoſe inward dictates may be made up of ſomething ſhort of rigorous Knowledge. It may be he will not allow a man with ſuch dictates to ſwear at all; but if he do, and ſwear according to them, I am ſure this Gentlemans Doctrine will excuſe him from Perjury.</p>
               <p>Again, if no leſs than true Knowledge, or down-right demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be neceſſary to every aſſertory Oath, there are very prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous doings in the World. Magiſtrates do very ill to put poor people every day to their Oaths, who never heard of a demonſtration, or if they did, know not what it means. And yet, I doubt, affairs of the World would go on but ſcurvily, if none but men of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration were capable to take Oaths. Mean time this cuſtom for Magiſtrates to offer, and people to take Oaths, where there neither is, nor can be demonſtration, has hitherto paſst for irreprehenſible: and I believe the Maxims which would change it, will be confuted by the exigences of the World. It being moſt certain, that nothing can be true, which is contrary to what is requiſite for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>He may poſſibly think the caſe of Tribunals different from ours; becauſe the Oaths requir'd there, are generally of matters ſubject to Senſe; whereas ours can only be known by Diſcourſe. But this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence does not hinder, but that the knowledge by Senſe (I ſpeak only of the matter in hand, of the certainty afforded by Senſe in the caſes wherein Oaths are required of, and taken by particulars, not medling with the queſtion, Whether abſolute certainty may not, in due circumſtances, be had by Senſe?) is ſubject to error, as well as the knowledge by Diſcourſe: perhaps more, but 'tis undeniably not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. And then the caſe is the ſame. For it imports nothing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the knowledge, according to which we ſwear, be deriv'd from Senſe, or Diſcourſe, when 'tis clear that both may fail, and he who thinks he has true knowledge either way, be deceiv'd. Wherefore evidently, either rigorouſly true knowledge, by which, I ſuppoſe, he means ſuch as excludes all poſſibility of deceit, is not alwayes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or no Oath can be taken, not ſo much as in matters ſubject to Senſe.</p>
               <p>If he think otherwiſe, I would ask his opinion in a caſe not feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at random, but which actually hapned. In a Robbery commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome of the adjacent Countries, one of the Thieves Horſes chanced to be taken. This Horſe was rid up to <hi>London,</hi> and when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53776:24"/> he came into the Town, had his Bridle given him, his Rider thinking he might poſſibly find out his own Inn. He paſt by ſeveral, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Streets, and at laſt went into one. The Oſtler there being askt if he knew the Horſe, reply'd, he did, that he uſually ſtood there, and that he belong'd to ſuch a Gentleman. This Gentleman was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Seſſions then hapning to ſit, arrain'd and condemn'd, the Oſtler ſwearing there all he had ſaid before. And yet after all, the Gentleman innocent. A Reprieve was got, by the benefit whereof he had time to ſend for his own Horſe, which uſed to ſtand in that Inn, and which prov'd ſo like the other in ſhape, colour, ſize, and every way, that no eye could find any difference.</p>
               <p>Now would I gladly know what this Author thinks of this Caſe? whether this Oſtler were perjur'd, and ow'd a forfeiture to the Pillory? If he think he was, He is of a different judgment from thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Law, and the World better than he. For no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inflicted on the Oſtler, nor was it thought he deſerv'd any. If he concur in opinion with them, he muſt allow an Oath, without true knowldge, may be unblamably taken. For this Oſtler ſwore, not only what he knew not, but what was abſolutely falſe.</p>
               <p>Becauſe a little more reflexion on this may peradventure unravel all the difficulty, let us conſider what 'twas excus'd the Oſtler, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if what excus'd him be found in other ſwearers, it will not alſo excuſe them. He had reaſon to ſwear, urg'd by the love of Juſtice, and call'd by the Magiſtrate. He ſwore according to the Dictates of his Conſcience, and had ſuch motives for thoſe Dictates, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they deceiv'd him, yet no body judged <hi>that</hi> deceit, or him faulty. Let another man ſwear in due circumſtances, according to his conſcience, and with ſuch reaſons for that conſcience, that if he fail, the unpaſſionate. World ſhall lay the blame upon the weakneſs of deceivable Nature, not on him. This man, I think, is in the Oſtler's caſe, unperjur'd, and irreprehenſible, even though what he ſwears ſhould happen to prove falſe.</p>
               <p>I gather then, that by the Truth requiſite in an Oath, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge requiſite to come by that Truth, is not underſtood Truth in it ſelf, or Knowledge in it ſelf, but Truth to the Swearer, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Swearer: That is, that what he ſwears be fixt in him as <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Known,</hi> not as <hi>doubted,</hi> or <hi>thought,</hi> or <hi>uncertain.</hi> And, I conceive, he ought to be provided of ſuch reaſons for this fixure,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53776:25"/> that if they be ſuppos'd to fail him, no unbiaſt man ſhall think him therefore a leſs honeſt man, or give leſs credit to his Oath another time. If he doubt, or be conſcious of any juſt cauſe of doubt, if he be aware that he does not know what he thinks he does, and yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſwear, I conceive the Pillory a puniſhment of the mildeſt for him, who makes ſo bold with the reverence due to God.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why I am thus perſwaded is, becauſe on the one ſide I ſee all the World agrees with his former Doctrine, that Perjury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the oppoſition, not to Truth preciſely, but, to Conſcience. For it is indeed nothing elſe but a Lye ſworn; and every body knows I can Lye, and yet ſpeak truth, as likewiſe ſay what is falſe, and not Lye. So that it cannot be Truth in it ſelf, but Truth to the ſwearer, which is expected in Oaths. On the other ſide, I ſee, that unleſs this were ſo, there could not poſſibly be any ſwearing in any caſe. For it being impoſſible to divorce our ſelves from the infirmity of Nature; and Senſe, and Diſcourſe, the only wayes we have to get Truth into us (I bar Faith, as unconcerning at preſent, and with which I will not meddle, for fear of embroiling things unneceſſary) being <hi>both</hi> ſubject to deceit, Truth cannot otherwiſe be drawn from us by Oath, but as it is in us, accompani'd with a poſſibility indeed of deceit, but againſt which we have us'd all cautions of which we are capable, and ſo that we remain fully ſatisfi'd, that actually we are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. And who will not take Truth in this manner, muſt require more than can be had, and abſolutely take ſwearing out of the World.</p>
               <p>But I ſtray, and forget that I am only to anſwer. To return to my task. I cannot imagin what this unbefriended Oath of Allegiance has don, to be treated with harder meaſure than other Oaths. I am ſure he is not to learn, that his Knowledge which muſt ſignifie Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is not requir'd to ſwearing by every body, and that Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will ſerve the turn of thoſe who paſs for knowing men. I think I need never quote for the matter, eſpecially while the words of <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> are to be read in the <hi>Preface.</hi> For he ſays, not only that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, with ſufficient care, excuſes from Perjury; but likewiſe that 'tis the common Doctrine. However, I will add a paſſage or two out of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> becauſe, I ſuppoſe, he is as good as a great many, ſince he pretends to write the ſenſe of a great many.</p>
               <p>He tells us, <hi>that he is perjur'd, who ſwears what he takes to be falſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mor. Theo.</note> 
                  <hi>though it be otherwiſe true. But not ſo, if he probably think it true,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53776:25"/> though it be otherwiſe falſe.</hi> Again, <hi>that</hi> in Foro conſcientiae, <hi>a man</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trac. 1. Exam. 3. C. 3. In Prax. C. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>may ſwear what he has heard from a man of credit, though not in external Courts, where he muſt give an account of what he ſays.</hi> Farther, putting this Queſtion, Whether I who know a thing to be true, may induce another to ſwear it, who knows it not? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>No, unleſs this other be firſt perſwaded of the truth by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ground.</hi> For my own part, I muſt needs declare, I like not this Doctrine, and ſhould not dare to ſwear what I thought only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. But ſince (the worſe luck for the World) it is, as <hi>Suarez</hi> ſays, <hi>common,</hi> I ſee not why this Gentleman needed to be more nicely ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous than others are, and muſt ſuſpect that Kiſſing goes by favour in more places than one.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, That ſevere Truth in it ſelf, and that known by ſevere knowledge, ſuch as admitting no allay of human weakneſs is abſolutely irreconcilable with all miſtake, is not indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to an Oath, I take to be both clear in it ſelf, and clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. It remains to ſee, whether it be requir'd to this particular Oath of Allegiance, by thoſe who fram'd, and offer it. And becauſe when we know what 'tis they expect from this Oath, we may judge whether this ſevere knowledge be neceſſary to that or no, let us reflect what they do, or can aim at by it.</p>
               <p>Is it perhaps to diſcover the Truth of the Queſtion? Alas! our credit is not ſo great with them, that they ſhould think any thing the more or leſs true for what we hold concerning it. They will not believe any point in difference betwixt us a jot the ſooner, if we ſwear it five hundred and five hundred times over. They have ways of their own, on which they rely for the finding out of Truth, and care not a ſtraw what we think of it. Again, Truth in matters of this nature, may be diſcover'd otherwiſe than by Oath. Nay, an Oath is no proper means to diſcover it. For unleſs it be ſuppos'd the ſwearer both knows what he ſwears, and ſwears according to what he knows, his Oath is no ſecurity. But there are other means which will bring thoſe, who faithfully purſue them, with ſecurity to her. Wherefore I ſee not how it can be imagined they look for Truth it ſelf by this Oath, while they may have that Truth without it; and if they could not, perhaps would be better content to remain ignorant, than be inſtructed by us.</p>
               <p>Allow them but common ſenſe, and it will move us to believe they expect from the Oath, ſomething which they cannot have without it.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53776:26"/> Of the Truth of this Queſtion, Whether the Pope can depoſe? they may be, and are ſatisfi'd whether we ſwear or no; but what we hold concerning it, they cannot know but by our ſwearing. For this lies hid in our breaſts till we declare it. And though we do declare what we hold, if we refuſe to confirm our declaration by Oath, we free them not from the ſuſpicion they may have that we deal not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. An Oath is very proper to ſatisfie them in this point; and becauſe it can ſatisfie them in nothing elſe, I think it cannot rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought, they expect any thing elſe from it. Barely then to know what we hold, and what they cannot otherwiſe know but by our ſwearing, is all they can propoſe to themſelves by this Oath. Whether what we hold be true or not, is no ſuch ſecret, that they need Oaths, and leaſt of all ours, to find it out.</p>
               <p>Neither does it concern them what degree of certainty we have for what we hold. That belongs to our own conſciences, of which we muſt take care, and be provided to give account to God. But for their parts, I am ſure they cannot be imagined to require ſevere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration in every one from whom they expect the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, when they offer it to thoſe who, they know, do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo much as what the word means. The Law propoſes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to All, to the Illiterate, Artificers, Plow-men, Women, if I miſtake not, as well as others. To think thoſe who fram'd this Law ſo extravagant as to require, or think there can be found Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in theſe, is in my opinion a greater extravagance.</p>
               <p>But they have taken ſo much care to explain themſelves, in the words they have choſen for the Oath, that if they be miſtaken, I know not how it can be otherwiſe than wilfully. The Wood was all in their own Power, and they might have made their Staff of what Tree they pleas'd. They might as eaſily have ſaid, <hi>I ſwear the Pope has no power to depoſe,</hi> and <hi>I demonſtratively know he has not,</hi> as, I <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>ſincerely acknowledge and declare in my conſcience</hi> he has not. If any words can be found which expreſs more clearly, that what they require is, that we ſhould acknowledge the truth of what we ſwear, only as it ſtands in our conſciences, and without inquiring which way we came by it, or with what degree of certainty we hold it, I ſhould be glad to learn what thoſe words are.</p>
               <p>For my part, as I love Juſtice even to Enemies, I cannot but think, it would a great deal more become us to acknowledge, and thank their moderation and tenderneſs in this point, than to perplex our ſelves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53776:26"/> and others with captious Cavils, which they ſeem even to have taken care to prevent. In the mean time I conceive that this ſevere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which he requires, is not requir'd by any body but himſelf: and that enough has been ſaid to ſhew it, and indeed more than enough. For ſince he barely ſays ſo, I might have ſpared all this pains, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deni'd it without more ado. For, I hope, he will not pretend he has brought any proof.</p>
               <p>Beſides the neat amplification by variety of phraſe, there are but two things that look like proof. The firſt is, when he ſays, <hi>that this want of knowledge will condemn him</hi> who ſwears, <hi>at the bar of his own heart.</hi> And this is plainly to ſay, there muſt be ſomething in his heart to condemn him: ſome conſciouſneſs that the beſt of his knowledge is indeed no-knowledge. Otherwiſe, if that <hi>beſt</hi> appear <hi>good</hi> and <hi>true knowledge</hi> to his heart, there is nothing there which can condemn him. The next is the Caſe of a Witneſs who ſhould offer to ſwear what, being askt, he ſhould confeſs he knew not; and he too is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcious that he does not know. So that this being all he ſayes, I cannot think himſelf will ſay, here is any proof, or any reaſon why he may not ſwear, whoſe heart is not conſcious of want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>But though I conceive, the beſt of a mans knowledge is all that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants require in this Oath, and all that is neceſſary to any Oath, (I mean <hi>ſuppoſitis ſupponendis,</hi> that the ſwearer have faithfully, and to the utmoſt of his power laboured to ſatisfie himſelf of the truth, and ſatisfi'd himſelf at leaſt by ſuch motives as will excuſe him from blame before God and man, and that there be no paſſion, no raſhneſs, no want of ſincerity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet I do not think this is all the matter will bear. Knowledge may ſignifie Knowledge, provided it do not ſignifie Artificial Knowledge, and be had in this caſe, if it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, even by the unlearned. For they can tell, as well as the beſt Mathematician in the World, that the neareſt way from <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet</hi> to <hi>Covent-garden</hi> Church, is to go by the Dyal, not through the Arches; that more Corn will go into a round Bag, than a three cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd one of the ſame cloath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they never heard of Circles, and Angles, Sides, and Diagonals, nor know what they mean. If ſuch kind of knowledge as this, no leſs certain nor leſs ſtrong than the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, will ſerve turn, I do not ſee why the Oath of Allegiance ſhould be rejected for want of knowledge.</p>
               <p>Whoever has knowledge enough to take a Leaſe, and manage a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53776:27"/> Farm, can tell there is a difference betwixt him who holds by Leaſe, and him from whom he holds it: That the Soveraign Lord holds of no body: That if the King may forfeit to the Pope, and be ejected by him, He is not Soveraign, whom yet he has alwayes call'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd his Soveraign: That the obligation to obey our Soveraign, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Land, is commanded by the Law of God: That when People fight againſt them, they do not obey them: That ſuch diſobedience is contrary to what he has been taught is the Law of God; and a hundred ſuch things, which thoſe who have the Art, may weave into abſolute Demonſtrations, and which afford a very abſolute certainty to the reſt who were never Prentice to that Trade. Nor can all the ſcholaſtical ſubtilties in the World, how much ſoever they may blunder them in the mean time, when they ſee men up in Arms againſt the King, perſwade them, that fighting againſt him is not fighting againſt him; or that they treat him as their Soveraign, whom they do fight againſt; or that the Doctrine which ſays this may be don, is not contrary to that which ſays, It may not be done; which they can as well know to be the Doctrine of God, as any other which they believe and hope to be ſav'd by.</p>
               <p>But <hi>this,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>qualifying gloſs, and milder expoſition, cannot be transferr'd to the Oath of Allegiance.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an exchange of one Perjury for another; ſtriving to weather one Rock, and ſplitting on another.</hi> Which be theſe two inevitable Rocks, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you? Why, <hi>if you pretend</hi> not to abjure, <hi>this is contrary to the expreſs words, according to which you profeſs to ſwear, and by which you do expreſly ſwear, that the Pope hath not any Depoſing Power.</hi> Very good! Expreſs words are things, as luck is, ſubject to Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. <hi>Tom Tinker,</hi> if he be not blind, can judge this matter, as well as <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Let us take then Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s pair of witneſſes, our <hi>two Eyen,</hi> and make them Judges of this difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning of the Oath, the Swearer,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſolemnly calls God and the World to witneſs the truth of what he is about to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. What are the words in which he does this? my Eyes tell me they are theſe: <hi>I do truly and ſincerely acknowledge, profeſs, teſtifie, and declare in my conſcience,</hi> That the Pope hath not any Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By your favor, Sir, this is not to call God and the World to witneſs the truth of what I acknowledge, but the truth of my acknowledgment, or that I am ſincerely perſwaded, that what I acknowledge is true. I beſeech you let us have fair play, and a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53776:27"/> wrong Card not ſhufled into our hands. The words expreſly deny the depoſing Power to be true in or to the Swearers Conſcience; of the Truth in it ſelf, my eyes diſcern none which ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Then he glances at one of the middle Clauſes, in which he ſays, <hi>The Depoſing Power is not only abjured, but abjur'd as Heretical.</hi> The Clauſe is this: <hi>And I do further ſwear, That I from my heart abhor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and abjure as impious and heretical this damnable Doctrine and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That Princes which be excommunicated or depriv'd by the Pope, may be depos'd or murther'd by their Subjects, or any other whatſoever.</hi> The word <hi>Abjure</hi> in this place, I take to ſignifie; <hi>ſolemnly renounce;</hi> or elſe for a word of ſupererogation, added according to the uſual redundancy of the Law ſtile, and ſignifying but the ſame with the former in a ſynonimous expreſſion, as <hi>Deteſt</hi> ſuper-adds nothing to <hi>Abhor,</hi> nor <hi>Poſition</hi> to <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Unleſs perhaps it be taken in the ſame ſence, as when People <hi>abjure</hi> the Kingdom, or any thing elſe, when they are requir'd by Law; that is, ſwear never to come into it more. And then it ſignifies, I will never hold this Doctrine. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the words would import, I ſwear that I ſwear, or that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear, which ſeems no very good ſence, and I think it is not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to interpret a Law into nonſence. If this be ſo, the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs deteſting, and abhorring, (and, if you will, never holding the poſition mentioned) as heretical, but there are none which ſay expreſly, that 'tis heretical, or ſo much as falſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt, and only Clauſe he cites, ſays we ſwear <hi>according to the expreſs words,</hi> and thoſe expreſs words our eye-ſight tells us, are not of Truth preciſely in it ſelf, but of Truth with relation to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And ſo inſtead of ſplitting on his Rock of Perjury, we have got a Lanthorn to avoid it. Thanks to their care who hung it there, and who for their pains deſerve a better return than ſcrupulous Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confutable even by eye-ſight.</p>
               <p>The other Rock, and which he conceives inevitable, <hi>Is the charge of Perjury now under his Pen.</hi> Viz. <hi>Abjuring without neceſſary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which, while the diſpute remains undetermined by publick, and undeterminable by private Authority,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is not to be had, nor expected.</hi> I have already ſaid, there is no neceſſity of running upon this Rock at all. Who does, will find it but Sand, and never endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſplitting. For, as is formerly diſcours'd, rigorous knowledge is not neceſſary, and though it were, is very poſſible to be had. Then as ſure as he thinks himſelf, that the point is undeterminable by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53776:28"/> authority, I muſt beg his permiſſion to believe it may be, and is determined even by private men, not authoritatively indeed with reſpect to others, but effectually as to themſelves: or rather, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men may be and are determined concerning it, and that with ſufficient and poſſibly abſolute certainty. For ſure Privacy is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the diſcovery of Truth, unleſs private men be all ſuppoſed blind: and I am ſure Diſputing is much leſs. For it is the nature of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes to bring Truth to light, and make us ſee what otherwiſe perhaps we ſhould not. Wherefore that Knowledge cannot be had while the point remains in diſpute, and that becauſe it is not effectually deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by publick Authority, it is therefore undeterminable, ſeem to me, not Rocks, but Paradoxes.</p>
               <p>And truly, now this Gentleman, with his Rocks and his Perjuries, has given me occaſion to reflect on the Oath of Allegiance, more than ever I did before, I muſt needs profeſs I find it no ſuch hideous matter; and the more I reflect the leſs hideous I find it, and begin to ſuſpect it was want of reflexion that makes the Idea ſo terrible. Who will not truſt his own eyes, may poſſibly meet with a glaſs which may repreſent the object otherwiſe than it is. Let us take it in pieces, and conſider it a little.</p>
               <p>The firſt part acknowledges, <hi>The King is rightful King of all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and that the Pope has no authority to depoſe him, diſcharge his Subjects from their Allegiance, licence them to bear Arms againſt him,</hi> and the reſt. He who does not acknowledge the King to be rightful King, or does acknowledge the Pope has ſuch Power, has indeed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forbear ſwearing. And this latter is the reaſon alledged by thoſe who have written againſt the Oath of Allegiance. But I ſee not what other good reaſon there can be. At leaſt this, of want of knowledge, alledg'd by this Gentleman, ſeems not well to bear the name. For the words are not, <hi>I know,</hi> but <hi>I acknowledge;</hi> and beſides, has he not knowledge enough to ſwear the firſt branch, That the King is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King? I ſuppoſe he will not ſtick at that; but is his Knowledge of that, true Knowledge? If it be not, I think he can content himſelf ſometimes with Knowledge which does not ſignifie Knowledge; If it be, he may allow others to hope for Knowledge in things not altogether ſo hidden and imperious, as thoſe, which he ſayes he knows.</p>
               <p>There follows the promiſſory part, in which, who takes the Oath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>notwithſtanding any Declaration,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Pope, he will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53776:28"/> bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majeſty.</hi> And this is the very thing he would be at, and which <hi>P.</hi> 8. he offers, as the proper matter of an Oath of Allegiance; And which I therefore conceive neither he, nor any body elſe will except againſt.</p>
               <p>Then comes the Clauſe formerly glanc'd at by him, and fully ſet down by me, which who refuſes, does by that refuſal profeſs, he does not abhor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Poſition mention'd as Heretical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For you do not directly ſwear any thing is heretical. The ſwearing falls upon the <hi>Abhor,</hi> and the Abhor upon the <hi>Heretical.</hi> However, I perceive by him the word <hi>Heretical</hi> ſticks, but I cannot tell where. And 'tis one of the moſt uncomfortable things in the World, to be ſtill vext with ſcruples, and not know what they are. There has been ſaid of this word by diverſe, what might ſeem to purpoſe, unleſs ſome body would tells us why it is not. Methinks it is but reaſonable, if we muſt remain unſatisfi'd at that word, we ſhould be told, wherefore that which has been ſaid to ſatisfie us, will not do. To take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing to the contrary, and ſtill go on in doubts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, is, I think, the very thing we call Scruple. However, it is not poſſible for me to judge whether the Exceptions which I find this Gentleman has to that word, be rational, or no, unleſs I knew what they were. All I can do, is ingenuouſly to declare what I think of the matter, and leave him and every body to judge whether my thoughts be rational, or no.</p>
               <p>I know it is an uſual exception, that the Pope's depoſing Power cannot be abjur'd as Heretical, becauſe the direct contrary Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being neither expreſly found in Scripture, nor Councels, nor unanimouſly believ'd by Catholicks, among whom it is conteſted, is conceiv'd therefore not to belong preciſely to Faith: And Hereſie is oppoſite to Faith, <hi>Falſe</hi> being different from, and not enough to make <hi>Heretical.</hi> I know alſo that diverſe things have been alledged to ſhew there is more of ſcruple than ſubſtance in this exception, and that there is no reaſon to underſtand the word Heretical in that rigor, when 'tis plain the Proteſtants do not underſtand it ſo, and we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly enough underſtand it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>For is it not undeniable, that Proteſtants know every jot as well as our ſelves, that this Propoſition, <hi>The Pope has not power to depoſe,</hi> is not expreſly, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> to be found in Scripture, or Councils, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by all Catholicks? Is it not utmoſt extravagance to think, that when they ſwear themſelves they mean to ſay by the word Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53776:29"/> that the Propoſition above-mention'd is found there, or oblige us to think ſo, when they require the Oath of us? Wherefore if Oaths be to be taken in the ſence of the Givers, as I conceive they ought; They ſeem to have reaſon enough, who deny this ſence of the word <hi>Heretical</hi> can be the ſence of Proteſtants, and the meaning of the word in that place.</p>
               <p>Again, Among our ſelves, is it not as plain, that this word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken in another ſence? Have we not ſeen the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> object Hereſie to one another? Do we not ſee a hundred like Inſtances almoſt every day, where every body knows (the hot men themſelves and all) that what they call Hereſie, is not in Scriptures, or Counſels, nor uſually believ'd? Now, becauſe we are oblig'd to ſwear according to the plain and common ſence of the words, and there is a plain and common ſence of this word, different from that to which theſe ſevere men would reſtrain it, I ſee not why the exception, which ſome make to this ſeverity, is not, to ſay the leaſt, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as the ſeverity with which others except againſt the Oath.</p>
               <p>But all this, in my Opinion, is wide of the mark. I conceive this Gentleman is miſtaken, when he thinks the Pope's depoſing Power is in this clauſe abjur'd as Heretical. That Power was renounc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To make it renounc't again here, is, with an idle Tautology, to make the dead man be kill'd over again. As for that Point, The Oath contented it ſelf with a bare acknowledgment, only providing it ſhould be true and ſincere. Here it requires deteſtation, as of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and heretical Doctrine, without all doubt; what is now treated with more rigor, cannot be altogether the ſame, with what was treated more mildly before.</p>
               <p>And this, I think, is plain by the words of the Oath, which are to be our Guides in this matter. The words (for the Reader, I hope, will pardon a ſecond repetition) are theſe: <hi>And I do further ſwear, That I from my heart abhor, deteſt, and abjure, as impious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Poſition, That Princes which be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated or deprived by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatſoever.</hi> All Speech denying or affirming ſomething of ſomething, the way to underſtand it, is to mind what it is which is deni'd or affirmed, which the School Language calls the <hi>Praedicate,</hi> and that of which this <hi>Praedicate</hi> is affirm'd or deni'd, which they term the <hi>Subject.</hi> Of the Propoſition now, which I here ſwear that I abhor, what is the <hi>Subject?</hi> Is it not manifeſtly, <hi>Princes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53776:29"/> excommunicated or depriv'd by the Pope?</hi> And the <hi>Praedicate,</hi> is it not plainly this? <hi>Depos'd or murthered by their Subjects or others,</hi> if you ſtick to the preciſe words; though if you take the ſence, the <hi>Praedicate</hi> is, <hi>depoſable,</hi> or <hi>murtherable,</hi> &amp;c. For what the phraſe of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage expreſſes by <hi>may be depoſed,</hi> Logical exactneſs would word by, <hi>are depoſable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That Princes then can be excommunicated or depriv'd, is not here deni'd or affirm'd; for they are already ſo of whom the Propoſition ſpeaks, excommunication and deprivation making up a part of the <hi>Subject,</hi> of which ſomething elſe is <hi>praedicated.</hi> But what is abhorred, is, That ſuch Princes can be depos'd or murthered by their Subjects or others; this being the thing which is affirmed of thoſe excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and deprived Princes. The Pope is ſuppos'd to have done his part, and to have already depriv'd, or depos'd. There follows the Subjects ſhare, the ſupplying what the Pope falls ſhort of, and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulling out of his Throne him who will not voluntarily quit it. For if he do, the caſe cannot happen. Subjects cannot depoſe him who has depos'd himſelf. The Oath ſpeaks of a Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready depos'd by the Pope, but yet ſtill to be depos'd by ſome body elſe. We have nothing to do with any caſe in which both theſe are not found.</p>
               <p>Plainly therefore it is not, as this Gentleman ſuppoſes, the depoſing Power, as it is lodged in the Pope, which is here deni'd, but the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Power by Subjects or others. It is not Pope-depoſing, but Subject-depoſing Power which is now in queſtion, or if you will, not the Power, but the Practice. And the Queſtion is, Whether this Subject-depoſing Power may be abhorred as impious and heretical? Now I, for my part, conceive it may and ought, and think this ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that I would take <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, or this Gentleman for Judge, who yet ſay the direct contrary, if the caſe were not too cleer to need one.</p>
               <p>For does not <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſay, and whether he do or no, do we not all know, That <hi>we are oblig'd by the Law of God to obey our King,</hi> and that <hi>to deny obedience to our Prince is againſt the Law of God?</hi> He adds indeed, <hi>while he is King,</hi> and <hi>while he is Prince.</hi> But I deſire no more. It is evident by ſo much, that unleſs a King depriv'd by the Pope, ceaſe to be a King, he is to be obey'd, and that 'tis contrary to the Law of God, or flat Hereſie, to ſay the contrary, even in the judgment of <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53776:30"/>
               <p>Now I intreat this Gentleman to reflect, that whoever comes to this Branch of the Oath, has already ſworn another, in which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before God and the World, that he acknowledges there is no unkinging Power in the Pope, and therefore that notwithſtanding the Pope's deprivation, the King remains ſtill truly King. Wherefore if he offer to diſobey, or which is worſe, depoſe ſuch a King, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeys the King while he is King. Which if he hold to be lawful, he falls into what is by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and of all hands, confeſt to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Indeed if his Conſcience will not allow him to ſwear the former Clauſe, and tell him the Pope has Power to depoſe, neither will it ſuffer him to take this. But then let him ſay ſo, and ſtand to it, that the Pope indeed has ſuch Power, and not ſcruple at this Clauſe, which of it ſelf is liable to no exception, but what is drawn from the other. For Subject-depoſing is manifeſt Hereſie, unleſs Pope-depoſing be true.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be ſhifted off by ſaying, that ſince Pope-depoſing is not Hereſie, Subject-depoſing (by warrant from him, for I ſpeak of none elſe) cannot be Hereſie. I admit the Antecedent, becauſe the Oath not meddling with that Point, obliges us not to enquire after it; but there is no appearance of the Conſequent. If it be not Hereſie to make Diſobedience lawful after deprivation, becauſe that depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not known to be invalid by Faith; neither is Diſobedience he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, before deprivation, becauſe, even before, he is not known to be King by Faith. 'Tis by the Laws of the Land, and Eye-ſight, not by Faith, we know ſuch a man to be our King, and we know by Faith we are not to reſiſt him, whom we do not know by Faith to be our King. And ſo it is in all things commanded by the Divine Law. I do not know by Faith that this Woman is married, or the Mony in that mans hands is not mine, or that Creature is a man. But yet 'tis undeniable Hereſie to ſay, I may lawfully lye with that Wife, or take that mans Mony from him, or kill that man. However, I know the King to be King, reſiſtance is heretical, if he be King. And that I am fully perſwaded, and reſolv'd in Conſcience, that he is King, after deprivation as much as before, I have already ſworn, and therefore can no more refuſe to abhor reſiſtance to him as Heretical, than to abhor Adultery, or Theft, or Murther as Heretical.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I wonder how this word Heretical comes to be ſuch a Bugbear, unleſs by miſtaking, through inadvertence, one thing to be ſworn inſtead of another. I ſee people fancy, and this Gentleman is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53776:30"/> in for company, the Popes depoſing Power is there abjur'd as heretical, and I ſuppoſe they think it hard to cenſure for Hereſie, what too many Catholicks, too much unreprov'd, Alas! hold for true. And yet all this while there is no ſuch matter. That Power is neither affirmed, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd here; another thing is deni'd of it, <hi>viz.</hi> A lawfulneſs in Subjects, or others to proceed upon it. This indeed is abhor'd as heretical, the other Point is not toucht.</p>
               <p>Yet though it be not, in truth all depends upon it. For who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>Pope-depoſing</hi> true, has reaſon to check at acknowledging <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-depoſing</hi> Heretical. He who holds the former falſe, muſt think the latter Hereſie, or renounce his Faith, which evidently teaches Kings are to be obey'd. So that (to ſay what is) this exception againſt the bare word <hi>Heretical,</hi> is in reality an invention to maintain the Popes Power with leſs envy. Bluntly to ſay, that the Pope can turn any King out of his Kingdom, ſounds ſcurvily. Few mens Conſciences are ſo deprav'd, that they can hear it without check. But if people can be frighted into an acknowledgment of ſuch a Power in the Pope, and the Port reach'd by a ſide wind, the buſineſs is done every jot as efficaciouſly, and a great deal more ſpeciouſly. Now as Hereſie is on the one ſide an excellent tool to work upon a timorous Conſcience, and brings the commendation of Zeal to thoſe who appear wary of it, ſo on the other, it does the work excellently in this caſe. To ſay <hi>Subjects can depoſe is not heretical,</hi> declines the offenſive harſhneſs of ſaying <hi>the Pope can depoſe;</hi> But yet it ſays it. For there is no reaſon aſſign'd by any, nor aſſignable, but a Power in the Pope, to exempt it from Hereſie, or hinder it from being acknowledged ſo by all the World. Manifeſtly then this ſeeming exception againſt the word Heretical, is in truth an aſſertion of the Popes depoſing Power. I think it would not be ſo common, if every body were aware what they did, and minded, that while they only think to avoid Hereſie, they do in reality bring the King into ſubjection to the Pope, and eſtabliſh a Power in him, which is neither conſiſtent with civil Government, nor with their own thoughts. For there are not many, even of thoſe who refuſe the Oath, who do in earneſt believe that the Pope can depoſe the King.</p>
               <p>But I muſt deſire not to be miſtaken, as if I thought, becauſe the Doctrine is heretical, all thoſe who have held, or practis'd according to it, excluded from the hopes of ſalvation. I believe it is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to find more than one Hereſie in more than one man: and ſhould
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53776:31"/> every one who is caught tripping that way, be hopeleſly damn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado, the way to Heav'n would be a great deal more narrow than it is. I, for my part, think well-meaning goes far in all caſes: and that (till the contrary appear) the failings of men are rather to be imputed to ignorance, and weakneſs of nature, than malice of their minds, which I take to be the great obſtacle in the way to Heav'n. However, I declare, I think this conſequence, <hi>all who do ill things, are therefore ill men,</hi> very falſe, and ſhould think my ſelf wrong'd, if any ſhould go about to pin it upon me.</p>
               <p>The next Clauſe denies Abſolution from this Oath whether by the Pope, or any other. And here again the words relate, as expreſly as may be, to the belief and conſcience of the ſwearer, nor does he ſwear more. So that who is perſwaded accordingly, has nothing, that I ſee, which can rationally check him from ſwearing.</p>
               <p>The next renounces Diſpenſations to the contrary. And this, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is free from exception. For it is the very thing he offers after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in his promiſſory form, where he ſays, he will bear true Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, notwithſtanding any Diſpenſation to the contrary. Which I take to be renouncing theſe Diſpenſations, and conceive this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man does ſo too.</p>
               <p>He cites the following Clauſe at length, which only confines our meaning to the common ſence of the expreſs words. Now I ſhould never have thought it poſſible, that this ruſh ſhould afford a knot. For methinks 'tis all the reaſon in the World, that people when they ſwear, ſhould mean what they ſay, and I am ſure they ſay what the words, which they uſe, plainly ſignifie. But, to ſee how mens judgments differ, he has found here what, he would have us believe, makes much to his purpoſe. This, he ſays, <hi>ratifies and binds afreſh all</hi> that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>by a repeated and reflex Oath looking univerſally back upon the premiſes.</hi> And becauſe among thoſe <hi>All,</hi> the Pope's Power is one, and the chiefeſt, that Power is here forſworn again. True; but according to the expreſs words in which it was forſworn before. And theſe expreſs words are not, <hi>he has none,</hi> but <hi>I acknowledge he has none.</hi> I, but this is a mental reſervation excluded by this Clauſe. Juſt the contrary. To mean I acknowledge, when I ſwear I acknowledge, is no reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the direct ſence of what I ſwear. But if you, by Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will make me mean more than Acknowledge, you make me mean more than the words ſay, and drive me into a guilt, if it be one, from which the words take care to preſerve me.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53776:31"/>
               <p>What we acknowledge, and what we ſwear, that is, what we ſwear abſolutely, and what with reference to our Conſcience, is contained in the branches foregoing. This Clauſe meddles no farther with it, than to require what we have ſworn, be ſworn as it ought, with ſincerity, and without hidden meanings of our own, different from the plain ſence of the words. And becauſe this Gentleman ſeems an Enemy to ſecret reſervations, I believe on ſecond thoughts, he will allow, that to give ſecurity we have none, is not a thing at which our Conſcience ought to check. At leaſt, could we agree on the reſt, I am confident we ſhould not break off the Treaty on this point.</p>
               <p>The laſt Clauſe ſpeaks of the willingneſs and heartineſs with which we ſwear. Of this every man may have true, or at leaſt ſufficient knowledge, from the familiar converſe with his own thoughts, as he a little before inſtructs us. Wherefore, I ſuppoſe, he who is conſcious of willingneſs, and heartineſs, may without ſcruple venture on this branch. And this being all, I muſt needs declare upon the whole, I cannot perceive the Devil altogether ſo ugly as he is painted, and that the repreſentations made of this Oath, ſeem a great deal more hideous than the Oath it ſelf.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. V.</head>
               <p>I Have been larger in the laſt Chapter than I deſigned, or expected; but hope to make the Reader amends, and be leſs tedious in the reſt. After the main ſhower is over, the after-drops uſe not to laſt long, and a ſlighter covering will ſerve to keep us dry. The Title of his next Chapter promiſes to ſhew the manifeſt unlawfulneſs both of ſwearing, and forſwearing the depoſing Power. When he, comes to performance, he handſomely dilates on the competition, betwixt the two ſupream Powers, in the Queſtion of our Duty to God and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and then inquires, what a Private Chriſtian, and Loyal Subject ſhall do, to comply with both? And all I can underſtand by his anſwer, is, That he muſt fit ſtill and do nothing. For he will not allow him to judge, at leaſt ſo far as to ſwear, and if he do not judge for one ſide, he can act for neither, or if he do, muſt act without judgment. But if he may judge, 'tis plain he may ſwear his judgement. Now doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems to me a very ſurprizing, and no very commendable way
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53776:32"/> of performing Chriſtian Duties, and abſolutely impoſſible beſides. For a man muſt, in theſe caſes, act one way or another in ſpite of his teeth. Nay, not-acting may happen to be equivalent to the higheſt acting.</p>
               <p>But to do otherwiſe, ſays he, <hi>is to aſſume the right of Judicature,</hi> and as bad as <hi>to ſwear odd, or even, upon the ſight of a handful of Guineys.</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is plainly an equivocal word, being ſometimes meant of <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> Judgment, ſuch as is a Rule for the Actions of others; ſometimes for <hi>Not-authoritative,</hi> and which only ſerves to guide the actions of him who judges. In the firſt ſence methinks he ſhould not take it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems excluded by the very Queſtion, which is only of private men, and they judge only for themſelves. But if he do, as the word <hi>Judicature</hi> which he uſes is but ſeldom taken otherwiſe, I can only ſay, I know of no private man who pretends to that right of Judicature, and by his judging to oblige others to judge as he does. If any do, let him bear his own ſin, and the innocent not be involv'd in the guilt of his preſumption.</p>
               <p>But if he take it the ſecond way, I cannot underſtand why it ſhould appear ſo ſtrange a thing, if men make uſe of the guifts which God has given them. He never made man a rational and judging creature, with deſign that he ſhould not uſe his judgment when he had it. On the contrary, I conceive he expects we ſhould judge of what we are to do, or leave undone, and act according to our judgment, and from him who does not, I believe, will require a ſevere account. Nor do I underſtand what Principle, beſides Judgment, there is of Action, but Paſſion. I cannot think he would commend us to that for a guide, but if he do, I muſt entreat him to leave me to that which God has given me.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if we muſt not judge of this Queſtion, why does he write of this Queſtion? The Arguments he alledges, what are they for, but to make us judge, as he does. But nature is a little reſty, and will have it's flings. Twenty to one but ſome will judge quite contrary. If he will not allow theſe to be as free from blame as the other, he had e'en as good ſay, You may exerciſe your Judgments as much as you will, ſo it be on my ſide; but you muſt not judge againſt me.</p>
               <p>He cannot pretend for a difference, that he only judges of the Oath of Allegiance, but not of the Queſtion betwixt the two Powers. For he judges of that Queſtion too, and by judging firſt of that, comes to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53776:32"/> judge himſelf, and perſwade us to judge of the Oath. He judges that Queſtion to be undeterminable, and this as a private man, and by his private judgment; which hinders not another private man from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a private judgment that 'tis determinable. And if this man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue that judgment, and determine himſelf, and take the Oath, I ſee not, as to the right of Judicature, what greater liberty he takes than this Gentleman allows himſelf. Both judge, both act according to their judgement, (for refuſal is as much an act of the ſoul, as embracing) plainly either both, or neither uſurp on the right of Judicature. As for his <hi>odd</hi> or <hi>even,</hi> if he make the caſe equal, that as one ſwears only on the ſight of Guineys, the other ſwears only upon hearing the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I think as he does, there is no ground for an Oath. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as the Guineys may be told, the Queſtion may be examined, and peradventure True or Falſe as certainly be found there, as odd or even among the Guineys. What he has ſaid to the contrary, we have heard before, and if he will allow him the right of Judicature, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will judge of it. For my part, I ſhall not eaſily be perſwaded, that God has left us no means to know how we ſhould perform thoſe duties which himſelf requires and commands.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Chapter undertakes to confirm the Premiſes from this Topick, That <hi>the Point in Queſtion is confeſſedly a meer opinion, and therefore cannot be abjur'd, becauſe opinion does in its notion imply ſuſpence, and indetermination.</hi> He has indeed ſo far reaſon on his ſide, that this word Opinion, as it is oppos'd to Science, does ſignifie as he ſays. And I, for my part, agree with him, that it is not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſwear upon ſuch an Opinion. Yet I believe he knows there are who think otherwiſe, and who infer the direct contrary to what he does. For while he ſays 'tis an Opinion, therefore you may not ſwear, others in other caſes ſay, 'Tis an Opinion, therefore you may ſwear. If I ſhould turn him over to them, and make them his Pay-maſters, or deſire to remain in quiet, and not be preſt with his Argument, till they were agreed about it, I know not how he could refuſe me.</p>
               <p>But I will not take all advantages. The word <hi>Opinion</hi> every body knows is as ordinarily taken for <hi>Sentiment,</hi> or <hi>Judgment,</hi> in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, not to <hi>Science,</hi> but <hi>Faith.</hi> In which ſence many are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called Opinions, of which men may, and diverſe have, abſolute certainty. As I doubt not but St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> for example, was very certain of divers matters, which yet in the Schools paſs to this day but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53776:33"/> for Opinions. In this ſence of the word, Opinion and Certainty may ſtand very well together, nor can I believe the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> or the Author, or Publiſher of the Queſtions underſtood it in any other. I ſee not what reaſon there is to ſuſpect there was never more than ſuſpence and indetermination, even in the dulleſt of them. Nor can I imagin, that when the <hi>Sorbon</hi> declares the depoſing Doctrine falſe, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, contrary to the word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe can be fanci'd to ſay at the ſame time, ſhe was in ſuſpence and undetermin'd, whether it were ſo or no.</p>
               <p>As for what he obtrudes upon her, that her Declarations in 1663. were to regulate (not the Faith, but) Opinions of thoſe under their charge: if it were ſo, it is plain enough that Opinion in that place is oppos'd only to Faith, and ſo admits of certainty. But I cannot find that even ſo much is true. I have met with the Articles themſelves in more places than one, but not with any Decree of <hi>Sorborn</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, wherein thoſe expreſs words ſhould be. In the King's Declaration concerning them, the word <hi>Sentiment</hi> is us'd, not <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> for that wherein he deſires an Uniformity among his Subjects. The ſame word is us'd by the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> in their Decree of the Year 1626, upon occaſion of the Book of <hi>Santarellus.</hi> So that I ſee no great reaſon he had to beat the <hi>Sorbon</hi> for game, which, though he ſhould put up, I think would make no very good ſport. For I cannot tell what all this ſignifies, more than dearth of good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>THe following Chapter would not concern me, but for the odd uſe he makes of it. The buſineſs is to confute <hi>Withrington,</hi> and I ſhould think it matters not much what becomes of Objections againſt <hi>Withrington,</hi> while we have only to do with Objections againſt the Oath of Allegiance. <hi>Withrington</hi> was a man who, when he was alive, could ſpeak for himſelf, and now he is dead, might have reſted quiet in his grave, if this Gentleman had pleas'd. For I think it no great wonder, if from one who has writ ſo much as he, there ſcapt ſometimes what will not endure a ſevere Teſt. Whether he have been guilty of a weakneſs, from which I believe few in his caſe exempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53776:33"/> I think no ſuch important inquiry, that any man ſhould buſie himſelf about it, unleſs he be one of much leiſure, and much curioſity, and much concern for <hi>Withrington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But from the defeat of <hi>Withrington</hi> he draws an Argument againſt the Oath, as if it were unintelligible, ſince <hi>Withrington</hi> underſtood it not, and no man, he truly ſays, can ſwear what he underſtands not. To me now this ſeems a very odd conſequence, nor can I underſtand why the fate of the Oath of Allegiance ſhould depend on <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> Suppoſe he did miſtake in ſomething concerning this Oath, as I think this Gentleman has more than once; is the Oath therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible? The truth is, <hi>Withrington</hi> makes diverſe diſcourſes, and deductions, with which thoſe who ſee not ſo far as he did, neither do, nor need trouble themſelves. Among thoſe, in a Book not written preciſely of the Oath, he has found what he accepts againſt. Now I do not ſee but the Oath may be plain enough, whether his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be rational or no; but yet becauſe he would have us believe it is of conſequence, and frights us with <hi>woful ſnares,</hi> and <hi>apparent dangers,</hi> we will ſee what it is, and do our beſt to avoid thoſe ſnares and dangers.</p>
               <p>He tells us then, that <hi>Withrington,</hi> and his Friend <hi>C. I.</hi> ſay, That by one Clauſe of the Oath is deni'd indeed the Popes Power to <hi>authorize,</hi> but not to <hi>declare, or command.</hi> And pray why may they not ſay ſo, if it be ſo? For the Clauſe does ſpeak of authorizing, and it does not ſpeak of declaring and commanding. I ſee no ſuch <hi>ſubtile obſcurity,</hi> and <hi>learned intricacy</hi> in ſpeaking plain Truth. It ſeems they ſay too, That <hi>this Authority to declare and command, doth not exceed the limits of a Spiritual Power.</hi> Whether it do or no, is a Queſtion with which the Oath meddles not; and whether <hi>Withrington</hi> and his Friend be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in it or no, imports not the Oath. Neither are they miſtaken in that, however they fare in this matter; for what they ſay of the Oath, is manifeſtly true. Truly methinks this Quarrel might be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Gentleman may take his choice, and ſay <hi>declaring</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> does, or does not exceed the limits of a Spiritual Power, as he pleaſes, and no harm done that I ſee. All the miſchief, if he chooſe the contrary to <hi>Withrington,</hi> is, that <hi>Withrington</hi> was once in his life miſtaken, as another may be another time. He may alſo diſpute it with <hi>Withrington</hi> as long as he pleaſes: The Oath will remain neuter in the War, nor will all the <hi>ſubtile obſcurities</hi> and <hi>learned intricacies</hi> they can raiſe, hinder the plaineſt man that is, from perceiving, that the Oath ſpeaks only of <hi>authorizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53776:34"/>
               <p>But yet he apprehends the thing ſo obſcure, that he deſires to borrow his Readers eyes to help him out. I cannot but think his own eyes are better than mine, and that 'tis not their fault, if he ſee not better than I. However, ſuch as they are, with all my heart they ſhall be at his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Let us then, if we can, between us look out the mighty inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, which he would have us believe there is, in denying the Popes Power to <hi>authorize,</hi> and not denying his Power to <hi>command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Temporal Princes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as is here ſuppoſed, have Power and Authority to Invade or annoy Forreign Princes, or their Countrys, nay to depoſe them, when the good of Souls and neceſſity of the Church ſhall require.</hi> Whether what he ſays be ſuppos'd, or no, I cannot tell. For I have not the New-years Gift which he cites, and <hi>Withrington,</hi> in the place to which he refers, talks not of that matter: whether he do elſe-where, cannot be known but by reading all his Books. And, I hope, he does not expect I ſhould take ſo much pains to look for no matter what, I know not where. But this ſure is no ſuch myſtery. Every body knows that Sovereign Princes have Power and Authority to make juſt Wars, and every body ſees that if they prove ſucceſsful ſo far, the conquered Prince will be beaten out of his Kingdom. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body knows too, that the good of Souls, and neceſſity of the Church, may be a <hi>pretence</hi> of making War, either juſt, or which at leaſt may be prov'd ſo by the <hi>Ratio ultima Regum.</hi> If this be all the learned obſcurity, in which he thinks <hi>Withrington</hi> and his fellow plunged, there is no man in the World who is not as deep in the myre as they.</p>
               <p>Marry, whether all this amount to Authority in one Prince to depoſe another, is another Queſtion. Power I ſee they have, if they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Beſides Power, I ſee nothing but Reaſon, by which they judge, whether truly, or untruly, that they may uſe their Power as they do. If this be that which he, or <hi>Withrington</hi> means by Authority, He who ſays Princes have no Authority to depoſe, or do any thing elſe which they can do, ſays they have not Reaſon, and are not men. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moſt people mean by Authority, a certain kind of Quality, which, whenever it appears, ought to be ſubmitted to, in vertue of that appearance, and he who does not ſubmit, wrongs both him who has the Authority, and himſelf too. I know of no ſuch thing among Sovereigns. On the contrary, it ſeems to deſtroy the very notion Sovereignty. For a Sovereign is one who has no Authority above him. So we ſee that if one Prince aſſail, the other defends himſelf; if
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53776:34"/> he be beaten out of his Kingdom, he recovers it again if he can; and every body thinks he does well all the while, which would not be, if he were thought all the while to oppoſe a lawful Authority. Now becauſe in the Language of the World, to ſay one Prince has Authority to depoſe another, is to ſay, that this other is obliged to quit his Kingdom, when the firſt declares he ought ſo to do, as a Magiſtrate is oblig'd to turn private man, as often as his Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls his Commiſſion. He racks the words to a violent ſence, who ſays there is any depoſing Authority among Sovereigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Pope is to be Judge of this neceſſity.</hi> Queſtionleſs he may judge of it, and ſo may every Metropolitan, and every Dioceſan, and every ghoſtly Father, and every Privy-Counſellor, and every man whoſe judgment a Prince will deſire, or hearken to. All theſe may and do judge whether that neceſſity be ſuch, as to engage the Prince to a War. And the Prince may follow their judgments, or not, as he ſees fit, or unfit. I am much miſtaken if there be ever a Prince in Chriſtendom who thinks himſelf bound to enter into War upon any mans judgment but his own. Let the Pope judge it never ſo neceſſary, till he judge it ſo too, or at leaſt expedient, there will be no work for Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Pope hath Power (though not to authorize, yet) to declare, and not only to declare, but to command the doing of all this.</hi> What then? what terrible miſchief will come of all this at laſt? Why then, <hi>truly his Opinion is, that this Doctrine, as it contributes little to the ſecurity of Princes, and as little to the ſatisfaction of intelligent Readers, ſo it is not every one can eaſily underſtand, or be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it to Truth and it ſelf.</hi> A wonderful inconvenience! That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body ſhould not underſtand every thing, at leaſt not eaſily, and this only in his Opinion! Surely there needed not have been ſo much cack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for this Egg.</p>
               <p>It is not reaſonable I ſhould, for <hi>Withrington</hi>'s ſake, enter into the merits of a Cauſe, which requires more labour than I think due to his defence, and which is unconcerning beſides. Only becauſe he would perſwade us the defence of the Oath drives men into Doctrines <hi>unintelligible to Readers,</hi> and <hi>inſecure to Princes,</hi> it will not be amiſs to ſee whether <hi>Withrington</hi> were ſo hard put to it. As for the firſt Point, I wonder why the difference betwixt <hi>Authorizing</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> ſhould appear ſo unintelligible. Does not <hi>Authorizing</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie doing ſomething, in vertue whereof it is now lawful for him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53776:35"/> who is authorized, to do what before it was not lawful for him to do? Does not every body ſee that unlawful things are ſometimes <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> and that they become not lawful by being Commanded? Or if you will ſay, that only lawful things can validly be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore who puts a Power to Command, ſuppoſes a lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the thing commanded: There is ſtill a palpable difference betwixt commanding what of it ſelf, and independently of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is lawful, and making lawful what before it was made ſo, was not lawful. If he think Readers ſo little intelligent, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive this difference, I wonder why, and to whom he writes. For nothing he does, or can ſay is plainer.</p>
               <p>Then for the ſecurity of Princes, methinks it is ſomething, that <hi>Withrington</hi> allows not the Pope can make it lawful for one to Invade another. If you urge that he allows the Pope can command them, and therefore ſuppoſes they lawfully may; nay farther, that they ought do ſo, when the Pope commands, becauſe lawful Commands are to be obeyd: I conceive he might reply, that he ſuppoſes no more than all the World knows to be true. For we ſee Princes may, and do Invade one another every day. And for the Obedience urged to the Pope's Commands, in that Caſe, what if he ſhould ſay, the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Princes is, as the Service of Chriſtians, rational, not blind: That being entruſted with the Temporal Sword by God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to Him, not the Pope, for the uſe of it, They both may, and ought to conſider firſt with themſelves, whether what the Pope commands be lawful; and when they have found it lawful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be expedient: and reſt in both upon their own judgment, and thoſe in whom they confide, not the Popes. If <hi>Withrington</hi> ſhould anſwer in this manner, he might, for ought I ſee, eaſily enough clear himſelf, and his Doctrine, of prejudice to Princes. For by this account, they would never make War at the Pope's Command, but when they found that War both lawful and expedient by their own judgments. And this as often as they do, they will certainly make War, whether he Command it, or no, nay though he Command them never ſo much to keep the Peace.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I conceive, that though War be never ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and expedient, and neceſſary too, if you will, the Pope cannot command it. Becauſe (to abſtract from what the Pope has to do with the Temporal Sword) I think <hi>Command</hi> imports an obligation of performing the action commanded, purely in vertue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53776:35"/> whether the obeyer ſee the lawfulneſs or expedience of the action, or no; nay, though to his judgment it appear not-expedient. And becauſe Princes in ſuch caſes act in vertue of their own ſight, not of the Pope's Authority, I conceive they cannot properly be ſaid to be commanded, or to obey, even when they do what is ſaid to be commanded; nor can I believe the Pope ſpeaks in that ſtrain to them. Yet if <hi>Withrington</hi> would call it <hi>Commanding,</hi> he would ſpeak but as many do. For we ordinarily enough ſay, we have obey'd our ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, for example, when we have follow'd his directions in things which with our own eyes we ſaw convenient. But whether the word <hi>Command</hi> ſhall ſignifie ſo, or ſo, being a pure Queſtion <hi>de nomine,</hi> I think it not worth diſputing.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially while Proteſtants are wiſer than to amuſe us with ſuch unconcerning Speculations. They ſaw what truly imported, that all the danger lay in <hi>Authorizing.</hi> For could the Pope make it lawful for one Prince to Invade another, there might be Invaſions as often as the Pope pleaſed, and opportunity ſerved. Againſt this miſchief they provided; with <hi>Commands</hi> they would neither trouble themſelves, nor us, ſeeing that if the thing commanded be unlawful; no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it can be obligatory; and if it be lawful, it will be done without, and even againſt commands, whenever it is found expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>But to return to our matter, this Doctrine, <hi>If this Gentleman miſtake not, fouly claſhes both with Truth and it ſelf.</hi> Pray how with Truth? and how with it ſelf? But I might have ſav'd my Queſtion. For all he anſwers to it, is to ſay the matter over again, with the imputation of a ſeeming riddle, and then ask, whether it be not <hi>a meer mock pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſecurity to crown'd Heads?</hi> To which, as luck is, what is ſaid before will ſpare me the pains of anſwering. But whereas he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the relief of troubled Conſciences depends <hi>on this nice Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Authorizing and Commanding:</hi> I ſhould think no mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience need ever be troubled with it at all. If that will do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let it e'en be let alone; and <hi>Withrington</hi> for ſtarting, and this Gentleman for chacing it, ſhare the blame of troubling thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences between them. For the Oath obliges neither of them to meddle with it.</p>
               <p>At laſt he comes to ſomething, and tells us, <hi>this Diſtinction is in very deed no Diſtinction at all, neither in reſpect of the King, or ſwearer.</hi> Not to the King, becauſe <hi>it is all one to him whether he be invaded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53776:36"/> or depoſed by the Pope's Authority, or only by his Command.</hi> Very true, if he be Invaded and Depoſed. But it is not all one, whether he can be Invaded or Depos'd, or not. They who broacht the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, ſay he cannot, neither by the Pope's Authority nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand purely, and in other caſes than ſuch, in which he would have been Invaded and Depoſed though there had been no Authority, or command of the Pope interpoſed, nor any Pope to interpoſe them. And I think there is no King but will acknowledge, this is not all one as to ſay, He can as often as the Pope pleaſes.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the Swearer, he ſays, it is no Diſtinction, becauſe <hi>he cannot ſecurely, and without ſelf contradiction ſwear that the Pope hath not any Power and Authority to Depoſe Princes, if he have Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command others to Depoſe them:</hi> Why ſo pray? <hi>Becauſe this authoritative Injunction is enough to entitle him to the fact.</hi> Very well! Then an <hi>unauthoritative</hi> Injunction is not enough to entitle him to the Fact, and the Pope's Injunction to Depoſe, ſay the Diſtinction-men, is unauthoritative; <hi>And his very commanding others to Depoſe, both makes and denominates him the Depoſer.</hi> What? Whether there be Depoſing or no; or if there be, whether the Depoſing follow from his Command, or from ſomething elſe? Do I burn the Houſe which I Command to be burnt, if it be not burnt, or if it be, is burnt on other motives than my Command?</p>
               <p>Now, if the Diſtinction-men ſay, that Depoſition, even when it is commanded by the Pope, and when it happens, does not follow from the Pope's Command, but from the Expedience and Neceſſity ſeen by the Depoſing Prince, and in caſes where no Commands of the Pope to the contrary could hinder it, they are far enough from being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to grant his commanding Depoſition in that manner, denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates him the Depoſer. And yet the Pope may be ſaid a Depoſer too, if you pleaſe, as the Counſellors who adviſe the Depoſing Prince to the War, and the Soldiers who fight for him, may be ſaid Depoſers. But the Pope's Command being no cauſe of the effect, even when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, how a not-cauſe ſhould neceſſarily come to bear the denomination of an effect, which follows, when it does follow, from other cauſes, is in my Opinion ſomething harder to underſtand, than the nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction he thinks ſo unintelligible.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he tells us, That <hi>if it be true, what thoſe Authors aſſume, that Temporal Princes have power to Depoſe one another, the Pope, as a Temporal Prince, may put in for his ſhare among the reſt.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53776:36"/> and for the whole too, if he be ſtrong enough. But if thoſe Authors aſſume, or ſuppoſe, as he ſaid before, that this kind of Depoſing Power has any thing to do with the Oath, they are much out with their <hi>Aſſumes,</hi> and their <hi>Suppoſes.</hi> It is a wild Fancy, and which cannot, without injury, be fixt on the wiſdom of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to imagin they ever dream't of Depoſitions of this nature. Alas! it is not an Oath which can ſecure our, or any King from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven out of his Kingdom, if another, who is ſtrong enough, will in earneſt undertake it; no more than Laws can hinder a man, who is ſtronger than I, from taking away my Purſe, or Life, if he will.</p>
               <p>It was the ſtanding Right to Depoſe, claimed by the Pope, and by no body elſe, againſt which that wiſdom provided this Oath for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Againſt ſtrength, or that Right which may accidentally accrue to Temporal Princes, by breach of Treaties, or however their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels become juſt, they neither did, nor could provide. For who can tie up another man, both ſtronger than himſelf, and out of his reach? Reaſon, and their mutual agreements are all the ties which are, or can be among Princes. And there is no ſecurity but Force againſt him who will break them. In ſhort, I flatly deny there is any thing in this Oath which concerns the Power of Temporal Princes. And I deni'd before, that the Power, by which they Depoſe, is the depoſing Power meant by the Oath, or any body elſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo I beg the Readers pardon for detaining him ſo long, with an entertainment ſo ſlight. All has been, to know whether <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſpoke properly, or no, when 'tis not a ſtraw matter whether he ſpoke, or no. While the Oath ſpeaks not of Commanding, it is little to purpoſe to know what others ſay of it. Yet the Chapter made a pretty ſhew, the prettieſt, I think, of any in the Treatiſe, and people would have thought, peradventure, there had been ſomething in it, if it had been skipt over. But the ſubſtance is no more than you ſee.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. VIII.</head>
               <p>THe Seventh Chapter, to make way for a Parallel with the Oath of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Allegiance, compares firſt two more general Propoſitions: <hi>There is abſolutely no Authority to depoſe Princes,</hi> and <hi>There is abſolutely no Authority to depoſe Popes.</hi> The firſt of which, he ſays, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and rejected in <hi>France:</hi> the ſecond cannot ſafely be ſworn. And in this indeed he has diverſe Catholicks to take his part, though I do not approve of the reaſon he gives, why it cannot be ſworn, (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is diſputed) of which enough is ſaid before. Neither can I tell whether the caſe be abſolutely the ſame betwixt Popes and Princes. Thoſe who think Popes may be depos'd, think alſo, that Popes, in ſome caſes, are ſubject to a ſuperiour Power in the Church, by which they may be depos'd. Now put a Prince ſo independently ſovereign, that he is ſubject, in no caſe, to any Power, but that of God alone, his condition will be different from that which theſe men take to be the Popes. And it will not follow, that becauſe Popes may be depos'd, ſuch Princes can.</p>
               <p>But this matter concerns not the Oath of Allegiance, nor indeed the Parallel which follows. He ſays, if this Oath be ſpelt backwards, reading Pope for King, and King for Pope, it cannot ſafely be taken by any Catholick. And what then? So the Oath of Allegiance can be taken, no ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter whether the other can or no. Only I deny that it ought to be refus'd, for the reaſon he gives, <hi>the publick and unreproved diſputableneſs of the caſe;</hi> (For what elſe he ſays, is only to ſhew that it is diſputed) as thinking it very unreaſonable to ſay, let it be diſputed as much as it will, that it is unlawful for him who is in his conſcience fully perſwaded of the Truth of either ſide, to ſwear that he is ſo. For that muſt go to the Parallel, to make it exact. And whether it do or no, the Truth may be ſeen with certainty, and ſworn with ſecurity, notwithſtanding the Controverſie.</p>
               <p>As for the thing it ſelf, I cannot tell, but I ſuſpect that few, either Catholicks or Proteſtants, would ſcruple to ſwear, if there were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that Kings have not Power and Authority to depoſe Popes. Provided that King-depoſing Power be underſtood in the ſame ſence, as Pope-depoſing Power is underſtood in the Oath. For if it be meant of Depoſing by Force, undoubtedly there are Kings ſtrong enough
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53776:37"/> to drive the Pope out of his Chair. But underſtanding it of an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right, I conceive there is none, no not among the Enemies of the Pope, who thinks Kings have the ſame Power over Popes, which Popes claim over Kings. Neither does joyning with the Church alter the caſe. For as the hardneſs and weight of the Hammer with which I ſtrike is lodged in the Iron, not in my Hand; The Authority of the Church joyn'd to the King, does not ceaſe to be in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King uſes it, or rather is uſed by it. He himſelf puts the Depoſition to be by Authority of the Church; what Authority Kings have beſides, is but to uſe their own Power as they ſee fit.</p>
               <p>To meddle farther with what I conceive little material, I think not proper. It will be time enough to conſider better of it, when the caſe happens. Till then it ſeems an unconcerning ſpeculation, which I leave to thoſe who think it worth their pains.</p>
               <p>The following Chapter indeed concerns the Oath; but, for the greateſt part of it, not me. The ſubſtance is to ſhew, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter of an Oath of Allegiance is outward action, not inward perſwaſion, and therefore would have <hi>Will-not</hi> ſworn inſtead of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> What is requiſite for the publick ſafety, belongs to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe to whom it is entruſted, and they are to reſolve on the <hi>ſhall,</hi> or <hi>ſhall not:</hi> my privacy is confin'd to the <hi>may,</hi> or <hi>may not.</hi> Beſides, though I ſee no reaſon in the world why any mans Conſcience ſhould check at the <hi>Cannot;</hi> yet I have a great averſion from intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the liberty of others. I love to do as I would be done to; as I ſhould not take it well to have other mens Perſwaſions obtruded on me, ſo neither do I think it allowable in me to obtrude mine on other men. I thought it a charitable ſervice to examin whether the <hi>Cannot</hi> need be bogled at, if it be urged; but to make it be urged, I think neither charitable, nor rational. Let this Gentleman perſwade thoſe whom it concerns, to be content with his <hi>Will not;</hi> I, for my part, will throw no rub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in his way.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, I will do him all the ſervice I can. I will freely avow, I think he is in the right when he puts <hi>Action,</hi> not <hi>Judgment,</hi> for the proper matter of Allegiance. I conceive Magiſtrates need not be, and are not much concern'd what people think, ſo they always do what is fitting. Only Judgments which have influence on Actions under their care, cannot, I think, be excluded from their care. I will alſo avow, that I verily believe there are among the <hi>Will-nots</hi> as good
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53776:38"/> Subjects, and who in all Emergencies, even againſt the Pope, would approve themſelves ſuch, as <hi>Can-nots</hi> can be for their hearts. I would freely be bound, body for body, for ſome of them; For I know they would be <hi>Can-nots</hi> in their Actions, whatever they are in their Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Whether they can, as this Gentleman ſays, give us good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their Allegiance, is for them to judge, who are to look to that ſecurity. And to them I refer him, with this aſſurance, that I ſhall be very glad if they can agree.</p>
               <p>I ſee not what I have to do, till he comes to the <hi>Can-nots,</hi> and ſays of them, they may change as well as the <hi>Will-nots.</hi> And I cannot deny but Man is a Creature ſubject to change, nor can I ſee what ſecurity an Oath, or any thing elſe can give, that an honeſt man ſhall never turn Knave. I do not think the framers of the Oath, or any other, expected by it to alter Nature, and render Man unchangeable before his time. But yet the <hi>Can-not</hi> ſeems to have ſome advantage of the <hi>Will-not.</hi> For who is perſwaded that nothing can render diſobedience lawful, is more likely to prove obedient, than he who thinks diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may indeed become lawful, but yet engages never to be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. For why ſhould he not do a lawful thing?</p>
               <p>This Gentleman now will undertake to anſwer for both. I thank him for his kindneſs, and ſhall not be behind hand with him in good Offices, when I can be ſerviceable to him. He ſays, that both may be fixt by Oath, though with this advantage to the <hi>Will-not,</hi> that <hi>the Will may be fixt immediately, and Opinion only by means of the Will.</hi> I ſhall not conteſt upon the point of Precedency, nor envy any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Will-nots.</hi> But if he have nothing elſe to anſwer, I wiſh he had only anſwer'd for himſelf. Whether what he ſay in behalf of his way be ſatisfactory, I have already ſaid, is for them to conſider, whom it concerns him to ſatisfie. I, for my part, ſhall be ſatisfi'd with any thing, and whether I be or no, is no great matter.</p>
               <p>But for what concerns the other, I doubt they will not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fairly dealt with, by allowing them only bare Opinion (that is in his Language, a ſtate of ſuſpence and indetermination) to make them paſs for men, who would ſwear any thing, even while they were in ſuſpence, and undetermined concerning it. He may think ill of them, if they have deſerv'd it: but ſure they have not deſerv'd he ſhould think ſo ill.</p>
               <p>Again, What can be made of this fixing Opinions by Will? It ſeems to tread on the heels of a Bull. Since his very notion of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53776:38"/> implys not fixure, I cannot eaſily diſcern what good ſence the words can bear. Does he mean, that by willing long enough, and ſtrong enough, I can will my Opinion into Certainty, or not-ſeen Truth into ſeen Truth? This, I conceive, is ſomething hard to be done, and when it is done, it is not fixing Opinion, but unfixing Opinion, and fixing ſomething elſe in its ſtead. Or does he mean perhaps the juſt contrary, that the Will ſhall have that influence on the Opinions, that they ſhall never ceaſe to be Opinions, nor the Judgment ever paſs far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and arrive at Knowledge? This may properly enough be called fixing Opinions: but I do not think the Gentlemen of the other way will think themſelves much obliged to him, for teaching them an Art, how to be ſure never to come to Knowledge. Nor do I think it will be much ſatisfactory to any body elſe, to know ſuch order ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for their ſecurity, that as nothing is, ſo nothing ever ſhall be known of the matter, in which they deſire to be ſecured. What elſe remains for him to mean I ſee not, but that, whatever our Opinions be, we may be fixt to Act according as we ſhall ſwear. But this is to fix not Opinion, but Action. And whether the Action can be ſecurely fixt, till the Judgment, as well as the Will, be firſt fixt, concerning the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of that Action, is the difficulty he is to clear to thoſe, whom it concerns, and in which I wiſh him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
               <p>For my part I conceive this beginning at the Will to be a prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unnatural Method. I apprehend the nature of Man requires he ſhould be led by his Underſtanding. I ſee they are called Wilful who follow the dictates of their Will, (and Wilfulneſs is not reckoned among the Vertues) unleſs that Will be firſt ſetled by Reaſon, and that to follow it otherwiſe is alwais dangerous, and often blamable and vicious. 'Tis plainly for the blind to lead him who has Eyes; For the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is the Eye of the Soul. The right way then of fixing both Will and Action, I take to be by beginning at the Underſtanding, and fixing her firſt by the ſight of Truth, and by her the Will. For he, I think, will conſtantly act one way, who ſees he ought to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Thus, I apprehend, the Gentlemen of the other way may ſay they are fixt in the preſent caſe. They may ſay, They will therefore always ſtand by their King and Country, becauſe they ſee that ſuch is their Duty. They may ſee that God has commanded that Duty without this Exception, <hi>Unleſs the Pope depoſe.</hi> They may ſee the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for that exception deficient and unconcluding, and the reaſons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53776:39"/> againſt it ſtrong and convictive. And their ſight may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ther produce abſolute certainty, or, what in this caſe is equivalant, a full perſwaſion that it is ſo. For that is as much as the moderation of this Oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Hence they may rationally hope, that the imperfection of a changeable nature, of which it is impoſſible for them, or any body elſe, to deveſt themſelves, will not bring them into the ſuſpicion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changeable in their Allegiance.</p>
               <p>For there are but two ways by which they can change, either by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> changing their Judgments, or ceaſing to act according to them. And for their Judgments, they cannot change till what now appears True, come to appear Falſe, and the contrary True. And this, beſides that to them who ſee the Truth with certainty it is abſolutely impoſſible, is otherwiſe in our caſe a wild ſuppoſition. For when numbers of the beſt Wits of Chriſtendom, for ſeveral hundreds of years have ſtrain'd themſelves to the utmoſt, and yet failed to ſhew them this Truth and Falſhood, which are ſuppoſed may appear at laſt, to fear a change of Judgment from new Lights, is not much better than to hope to catch Larks with a Net made of the falling Sky. I believe Proteſtants will think themſelves well enough, if they be ſafe till that day come. If they do not, I know not how they can be ſecure of one another. For they are men too, ſubject to the weakneſs of changeable Mortality, as well as their Neighbours. And if they cannot be ſecure of other mens Judgments, becauſe of new ſuppoſed Lights, neither can they be ſecure of their own.</p>
               <p>As for changing the ſecond way, by ceaſing to act according to their Judgments, or turning Knaves, the caſe is, I ſuppoſe, excluded by the very tender of the Oath. For it is to no purpoſe to require Oaths of thoſe who are not thought honeſt men, and will continue ſo.

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>THe two laſt Chapters promiſe an Anſwer to the Author of the Queſtions, as far as concerns ours at preſent: yet the firſt ſeems only to take a care of the Jeſuits, who to my apprehenſion might have been paſt by, without prejudice to our Queſtion. For ſure to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whether the Oath of Allegiance may be taken or no, it is not abſolutely neceſſary to know how either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits have behav'd themſelves. I, for my part, have a veneration for the Jeſuits, and all Religious; though I muſt confeſs, I love all Orders better than any one, and Truth better than all. I wiſh them all the reputation they deſerve, and to deſerve all they deſire, and ſhall never by my good will raiſe any cloud, which may hinder it from ſhining in its full luſtre. Leaving the Jeſuits then to enjoy, without diſturbance, the Fruits of this Gentlemans Labors, the good Opinion of the Reader, I turn to what may appear more neerly related to our buſineſs.</p>
               <p>His firſt Exception againſt the Author is, for miſtaking the matter of Fact. And truly I think he did miſtake one Cenſure for another, the Cenſure of the <hi>Admonitio,</hi> for the Cenſure of <hi>Santarellus,</hi> which, as this Gentleman ſays, was not paſt till ſome days after the Decree, by which the Jeſuits were commanded to ſubſcribe. But I'do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what this miſtake makes or marrs, and, I ſuppoſe, no body would miſtake willingly, but for ſome advantage. That the Jeſuits in <hi>France</hi> actually did ſubſcribe the Cenſure againſt <hi>Santarellus,</hi> which is all he pretends, we ſtill have reaſon to believe. The Decree men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, beſides ſubſcription to the Cenſure againſt the <hi>Admonitio,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Jeſuits of <hi>Paris</hi> within three days to bring into the Court an Act, by which they ſhould diſavow and deteſt the Book of <hi>Santarellus</hi> expreſly, and procure the like Act from the reſt of the Jeſuits in <hi>France</hi> within two Months. It orders farther, That two of their body be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to write in the name of the reſt, Doctrine contrary to <hi>Santarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and bring their writing into the Court within eight days, and this under penalty of high Treaſon. Whether this Order were obey'd, I cannot tell, but the former was. The Act is extant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſavowing and deteſting the bad Doctrine of <hi>Santarellus,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſubſcribe the Cenſure which ſhould be made of that pernicious Doctrine by the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53776:40"/>
               <p>I hope I ſhall not be challenged of miſtaking too, becauſe this Act bears date 16 <hi>March,</hi> a day before the Decree. I ſuppoſe, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was ſigned, it was not brought into the Court before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſt, elſe methinks it would not have been required, if it had been there already. And it might very well be made before, in purſuance of a former Order, given them by word of mouth, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſome few days before perſonally in Parliament. However it were, it is apparent by the Act, that the Jeſuits did promiſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Cenſure againſt <hi>Santarellus,</hi> and actually did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, or break promiſe. So that while the ſubſtance of what is ſaid in the Queſtions remains in its full force, I ſee not how it import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Gentleman to uſe ſo many words about a circumſtantial mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
               <p>His next Exception I was very ſorry to ſee. He blames the Author for cutting off part of the Doctrine of <hi>Santarellus, with an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which he ſays, may beget a miſtake in the Reader, and give a different face to the matter. For it may be juſtly doubted, whether the Faculty would have pronounced ſo ſevere a judgment againſt the firſt part of the Doctrine, (viz.</hi> The Pope can depoſe for Hereſie) <hi>had not the laſt aggravating circumſtance (or rather cauſe) deſerv'd and ſharpened the Cenſure.</hi> Thoſe circumſtances are, That the Pope may depoſe, if it be expedient, if the Prince be faulty, negligent, uſeleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now for the <hi>Author,</hi> I conceive, by not citing the whole, when he promis'd only a ſhort Extract, he has done no great injury to the <hi>Reader,</hi> and none at all to <hi>Santarellus,</hi> or thoſe of his Order, by forbearing to ſay all the bad he knew. And for the thing it ſelf, if this Gentleman have a mind to maintain, that the firſt part of the Doctrine does not deſerve the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Cenſure, we ſhall ſee how good his Reaſons are, when he lets us know them. In the mean time I can hardly think they are of his mind in <hi>France.</hi> For ſure it was not for thoſe aggravating circumſtances alone, that <hi>Mariana,</hi> and <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> were burnt, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> condemn'd. The Exception he takes to the Cenſure, for not being ſeparately apply'd to each Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to my apprehenſion, makes againſt him. For it is a ſign there needed no ſeparation, and that the whole was corrupted into one maſs of perdition. And ſo I leave the depoſing Power to this Gentlemans protection, if he think fit to undertake it: wondring how favor to it ſhould concern the Queſtion in this Chapter, which in the firſt was foreign to this purpoſe: and grieving, that <hi>to depoſe</hi> even
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53776:40"/> 
                  <hi>for Hereſie</hi> ſhould be thought a Doctrine which needs aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to deſerve a ſharp Cenſure.</p>
               <p>There follows a pretty ſevere reprehenſion of the Author, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing the different conduct of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuites, might proceed from the difference of their Intereſts. To which I can only ſay, that we are all Mortals, and our tongues, and much more our thoughts, will ſometimes run before our Wits. I wiſh he were the only man in the World, into whoſe thoughts a ſuſpicion of Intereſt in Religious men had ever fallen. Were it in my Power to regulate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, neither ſhould the not-Religious ſuſpect, nor the Religious give occaſion of ſuſpicion. For if any do, I doubt they have the ſeverer account to make of the two. Whether they do or no, I will not ſo much as conjecture; though I believe this Gentleman underſtands the World too well, not to know the ſuſpicious Author is not without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in his fault, if it be one.</p>
               <p>But leaving that matter to him to whom the Author has, and every body ſhall make their accounts, He proceeds to ſay in behalf of the Jeſuites, that if the Cauſe of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> were the ſame, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could not in likelihood run any hazard by writing after the <hi>French</hi> Copy; but it is not the ſame; there being a bare Subſcription in <hi>France,</hi> and an Oath in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore no wonder if they act differently in different circumſtances. This is in two words, The Jeſuites always do well. Which every body may believe that pleaſes, for any thing I mean to ſay to the contrary. It concerns not our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that I perceive: and if it did, I ſhould undoubtedly ſide with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, where I could with truth.</p>
               <p>But the difference betwixt Subſcribing and Swearing, which he makes another miſtake in the Author, I take to concern our Queſtion ſomething, and proper to be conſidered. The Author ſays, That <hi>certainly no ſincere and generous honeſty will ſolemnly and deliberately atteſt under his hand, what he will not in due circumſtances ſwear to be true.</hi> What miſtake or harm can there be in this? Truly it ſeems ſo clear to me, that I wonder how they fell out about it, unleſs perchance this Gentleman, who thinks the Author miſtaken in his Poſition, be himſelf miſtaken in the Author. What the Author ſays is this: He who atteſts a thing is true, may ſwear it is true. I hope he does not underſtand him to ſay, that the Atteſtor may ſwear that is true, which he atteſts is doubtful, or barely probable, or uncertain. If he do, he miſunderſtands the Author, and the miſtake is on his ſide. Again,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53776:41"/> by <hi>True,</hi> I conceive no more is meant than <hi>True to the Atteſter,</hi> or that it be lodged or ſettled in his Judgment as ſuch, and that he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that what he atteſts is true, is peradventure not true. Not but that 'tis poſſible the grounds, on which he relys, may deceive him; but he muſt not be aware of any deceit, but be fully perſwaded there is none. Otherwiſe he cannot aſſert, it is true to him, his own heart witneſſing, that it is not true to him, or if he do, he is no honeſt man.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, what fault can be found with the Author? Is it not plain, that an honeſt man neither will, nor can atteſt that to be true of which he is not fully perſwaded that it is ſo? Is it not plain, that what is fully perſwaded is true, to him is true, not doubtful, or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or only probable? If it be indeed true to him, he may ſwear it is true to him, and in due circumſtances ought. Who refuſes to ſwear, plainly refuſes to do what he ought, and that is plainly to be wanting to what honeſty requires.</p>
               <p>What has this Gentleman to ſay againſt this? <hi>How! ſwear to be true?</hi> ſays he; <hi>and yet this Gentleman</hi> (the Author) <hi>knew full well (had he reflected on it) that the only Queſtion here is, of ſwearing or abjuring Opinions.</hi> Very like he did ſo; and he knew well too, that <hi>Opinions</hi> in that place ſignifies <hi>Tenets,</hi> or <hi>Points controverted,</hi> whereof one ſide is, and muſt be true, and, notwithſtanding the controverſie, may be ſeen to be ſo. And he underſtood, as all the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, that when a man has atteſted one of the diſputed Opinions to be true, he has atteſted that he is not in ſuſpence about it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that that ſide of the contradiction is true, and that it is not Opinion to him, as Opinion ſignifies ſuſpence, and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Why may he not ſwear this, if he can, and do attteſt it?</p>
               <p>Why this Gentleman is <hi>ſure, the daily practice of the Church, in a free and inoffenſive ſubſcribing of Opinions, abundantly confutes it. For what more uſual amongſt our greateſt Divines, in reſolving Caſes of weight and concern, than to deliver and atteſt their Opinions under their hand?</hi> Very well. And, I pray, what does Opinion ſignifie here? A ſtate of ſuſpence, and indetermination? So that when we conſult theſe great Divines, in caſes of weight, the ſatisfaction and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity we get from them, is, that they are in ſuſpence about the matter, and atteſt their ſuſpence under their hands. Truly if this be ſo, we plain men of the World are wonderfully abuſed.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53776:41"/>
               <p>We know our ſelves ignorant in matters which concern the conduct of our Souls, and take you to be knowing, who profeſs and exerciſe the Trade. Yet we are not ſo ignorant, but that we know there are ſeveral Opinions among you, and, if that were all, could take one at a venture which pleas'd us beſt, and never trouble you. But we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to proceed ſecurely, and come to learn of you, which of theſe Opinions is true, and we ought to follow. And when you have given us your reſolution under your hand, we apprehend, that your are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd your ſelves, not in ſuſpence and undetermined, and that the Opinion you commend to us, is true, as far as your judgments, on which we rely, can ſecure us. If it be otherwiſe, and your own jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unſetled, in that wherein you undertake to ſettle us, we are plainly deceiv'd. For we take your atteſtation for aſſurance that they are ſetled, and ſetled according as you atteſt.</p>
               <p>Truly theſe great Divines at this rate will run the hazard of being conjectur'd little honeſt men. And if this Gentleman have indeed a kindneſs for the Jeſuites, as one would gueſs by his writing, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they ſhould not be of the number of great Divines at this time. An honeſt man, who were ignorant of what he is askt, would ſay ſo, and ſend him who asks, to ſome body elſe who were more knowing. Or if it were a Point which no body knew, he would tell him inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly, and ſave him the pains of a fruitleſs enquiry. But to take upon him to be knowing, where he is conſcious that he is not knowing; to reſolve another, and in matters of weight, where he is not reſolved himſelf; to deceive thoſe who rely on him with an atteſtation of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, inſtead of an atteſtation of truth, which we deſir'd, and thought we had gotten; are things which among us, do not paſs for fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which when we obſerve among thoſe of our own Tribe, we think them not honeſt men who do them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I muſt needs believe Divines do not act in that manner, and that they are verily perſwaded that whatever they atteſt under their hands for true, really is true; however the greateſt of them may have their failings now and then. And I muſt needs give it with the Author againſt this Gentleman, not being able to ſee any thing which ſhould hinder a man from ſwearing as much as he atteſts. Nor do I think it reaſonable, that any one ſhould venture his Soul, where he who bids him venture, refuſes to venture his own. Nay, though his atteſtation ſhould ſignifie no more than that he is in ſuſpence, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would ſtill be in the right, who obliges only him to ſwear a thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53776:42"/> is true, who has atteſted that it is ſo, and therefore means no more than that an honeſt man will ſolemnly atteſt no more than he will ſwear. And ſuch an Atteſter I hope may ſafely ſwear that he is in ſuſpence; though when he has done, if he never will atteſt more, he had beſt keep it to himſelf. For thoſe who know it will be tempted to ſwear too, that they will never come at him more.</p>
               <p>And for the conſequence from ſubſcribing to ſwearing, I take it to be ſo far from a groſs offence to Reaſon, and Conſcience, Logick, and Divinity, that could I anſwer for all as much as for one, I would ſay poſitively they do all oblige a man to ſubſcribe no more than he can and will ſwear. I mean, as I conceive the Author meant, ſo as he ſubſcribes. If he ſubſcribes for abſolute, or evidently known Truth, he will ſwear that 'tis, or that he knows it True. If he ſubſcribe for True to his judgment, as it is generally, and always underſtood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the contrary be expreſt, he will ſwear it is true to his judgment: if for probability, that 'tis probable, and ſo however he ſubſcribes. For indeed ſubſcribing is calling the World to witneſs, that he is indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded as he ſubſcribes, and who refuſes to call God to witneſs too, in due circumſtances, gives more reaſon than an honeſt man would, to ſuſpect, that he deals not uprightly with the World.</p>
               <p>The laſt Quarrel he has with the Author, is for ſaying, That <hi>the Jeſuits are the ſtricteſt of all Religious in maintaining and extending the Popes prerogatives.</hi> This concerns the Jeſuits, not me; and though it did, I ſhould think it were good before I medled with it, to know of them, whether they take it for an Aſperſion. For if they do, I can tell them an infallible way to wipe it off. 'Tis but doing what this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſays they may without hazarding their concerns, writing after the <hi>French</hi> Copy, ſubſcribing a diſavow, and deteſtation of the Doctrine of <hi>Santarellus.</hi> If they did ſo, I, and every body, who think them ſincere men, ſhould verily believe they truly did diſavow and deteſt it; and, becauſe I believe them good men too, and would not diſavow, what they thought were true, that they were perſwaded the Doctrine of <hi>Santarellus</hi> is falſe. And then I am perſwaded, whatever this Gentleman has, they would have no ſcruple to ſwear, in fitting circumſtances, that they are ſo perſwaded. I will drive it no farther, for fear it ſhould reach the Oath of Allegiance, which in my Opinion is not far diſtant from this caſe. Nor had I ſaid ſo much, but only for the Example, which the matter afforded me, to ſhew the conſequence from <hi>ſubſcribing</hi> to <hi>ſwearing,</hi> is not ſo far diſtant as this Gentleman would perſwade us.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>THe laſt Chapter is made up of what elſe he has, or thinks fit to ſay, againſt the Author, a mighty weak man, in his Opinion, and who generally miſtates the Queſtion, even contrary to his own expreſs Aſſertions, and ſpeaks but little to it when he has done. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Queſtion be miſtated, it had been ne're a whit the worſe, if he had ſaid leſs: but methinks it does not hang very well together, that the Queſtion ſhould be miſtated by him, whoſe Aſſertions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary. I know not how a Queſtion ſhould be ſtated but by expreſſions, and thoſe which are contrary to miſtating; I ſhould think, ſtate it right. I ſhall only ſay, that there are ſome, peradventure as impartial Judges, and as careful Examiners, as other men, who have ſomething a better Opinion of the Author, and who think not a jot the worſe of him for what this Gentleman has ſaid againſt him. And there are who ſuſpect the Authors weakneſs was not the only reaſon, why this Gentleman would not anſwer the whole, ſince he has ſhew'd ſo good will to undertake him, by anſwering part. For my part, let every one judge as he pleaſes. Who judges amiſs, the fault and harm will be his own. I only mind what imports our buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he here diſlikes, is fetching over a Parallel from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> as asking why we may not profeſs as much as they To this he ſays, <hi>'Tis one thing to profeſs as much as they, and another to ſwear as much as they profeſs;</hi> whereof, <hi>though the firſt might, the ſecond cannot ſafely be done, for the reaſons formerly inculcated.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether this, <hi>though the firſt might,</hi> ſignifie it may, or it may not: for it may be taken either way. But if he be not diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the depoſing Doctrine, even as fully as the Oath of Allegiance requires, I would wiſh him to have a car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo much as of <hi>profeſſing</hi> what the <hi>French</hi> did; for fear of being drawn farther than he has a mind to go, and find the conſequence from <hi>profeſſing</hi> to <hi>ſwearing,</hi> ſtrain as well as from <hi>ſubſoribing.</hi> For <hi>ſubſoribing</hi> is but one kind of <hi>profeſſing.</hi> For the reſt, it is the old ſtory over again. Where I have met with the reaſons, he ſpeaks of, the Reader will ſee what I think of them.</p>
               <p>As for the Queſtion he asks, <hi>How it comes to paſs that the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance having been ſo long tranſlated; The</hi> French <hi>Univerſities have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53776:43"/> not voluntarily deliver'd their free judgment, and unanimouſly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd it?</hi> With the leave of thoſe to whom he ſpeaks, I muſt wonder he had ſo little acquaintance with the World as to ask it. I think few, beſides himſelf, ever fanci'd a <hi>French</hi> Univerſity ſhould ſubſcribe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oath of Allegiance. As for delivering their judgments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they would, if they were ſollicited by ſuch as had credit with them. Otherwiſe Univerſities do not uſe to aſſemble and make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to ſatisfie every private man. Private Doctors are ſometimes more forward, but then they carry leſs Authority, and every body knows that they are there as in other places, ſome for the Depoſing Power, and ſome againſt it. I believe it were not hard to find <hi>French</hi> Doctors, who ſhould declare the Oath unlawful; and thoſe who thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be ſhy enough of provoking the Pope cauſeleſly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring his ill will, to pleaſure, not ſo much as a friend, but, a meer ſtranger, and one with whom they have nothing to do. Beſides they have been told ſtories, of pretences which the Pope has by human right, as it appears by the Hiſtory of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Remonſtrance, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>Lovain</hi> were. Till they have ſtudied the caſe, which till it concern them they never will, They have reaſon to hold their hands. But though there were nothing of all this, it is not the cuſtom of one Nation to thruſt themſelves, without intereſt, into the concerns of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis enough for the <hi>French</hi> that they defend their own King, and 'tis enough for other Nations, that they defend him by Arguments applicable to other Kings, and which if other Nations will not apply, the fault is their own. Who expects the <hi>French</hi> ſhould do other mens work, and charge their own ſhoulders with the burthen of all Princes concerns, underſtands little of their humour. Every one is for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We interpos'd not betwixt the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and are like to hear as little of them in our Quarrels. If there were nothing elſe, the <hi>French</hi> have more civility, than by taking upon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide our differences, to aſperſe our Nation, as if we had not men of conſcience and learning among our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The next Quarrel he has to the Author, is for ſaying, <hi>The Depoſing Doctrine, however it may by ſome be held ſpeculatively probable, yet as to any execution, is practically no Power at all, againſt one in Poſſeſſion, and conſequently may be abjur'd as ſuch.</hi> This he calls his next Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſays, <hi>It begs the Queſtion, taking for an uncontrovertable truth, the only Point in controverſie. For the Depoſing Power hath been held, not only ſpeculatively probable, but ſafely practicable.</hi> True,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53776:43"/> it was ſo: but ſure it was held ſafely practicable only in force of a barely probable Speculation. For to ſay it was more than probable, is to ſay, it was certain. And that, I ſuppoſe, this Gentleman will not do, both for diſcovering more kindneſs to it than concerns the Queſtion, and alſo becauſe it were to unſay all that has been ſaid in his Treatiſe, and allow that one ſide of a controverted Queſtion may be certainly ſeen, and conſequently ſworn. Now if the Author had beg'd that a Power only probable, however it have been held, yet be not ſafely practicable, nor any Power to turn Kings out of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and embroil Nations in confuſion and miſery, I think he had been no impudent Beggar. For not ſo much as any private man was ever dipoſſeſt of a long enjoy'd Eſtate, by any Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, upon pretence of a bare probable Title in another man to it.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I have a great curioſity to know what this Gentleman himſelf thinks of the matter, whether Depoſing were ſafely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as it was held, or not. If he think it was, truly he has reaſon to quarrel with the Author, and all who maintain the Oath, becauſe they deny it is ſafely practicable. But then it were to be wiſht, he would own his true reaſon, and ſtand to it, that people may know what to ſpeak to. For if he think it was not ſafely practicable, I ſee no rational ground of quarrel he can have to the Author, who ſays but what himſelf thinks true, and begs no more than he is willing to give.</p>
               <p>But after all, the Author did not go a begging. He was not ſo poor at this time. This Gentleman miſtakes him, and calls that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is not. He diſcourſes in this manner: A <hi>certain</hi> general Rule is to be obſerved notwithſtanding an Exception that's <hi>uncertain.</hi> The Precept of <hi>Obedience to Kings</hi> is certain Catholick Doctrine, the Exception, <hi>unleſs the Pope Depoſe,</hi> uncertain. Therefore the Precept obliges, notwithſtanding the Exception. Hence he infers, in the words cited by this Gentleman, that though the Exception, or Power of the Pope be held probable, the practice cannot be allow'd, as 'tis manifeſt it cannot, if we muſt act according to the certain Precept. This, if it be Begging, is as fine begging as one ſhall ordinarily meet with. Few dreſs up their Provings more gaily.</p>
               <p>There follows, ſays he, another Argument: And ſo there does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great way off. For the Author it ſeems, in the 15 Pages which this Gentleman skips, has nothing to purpoſe, or elſe worth notice. The buſineſs is, (for I am unwilling to tranſcribe many lines) whether
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53776:44"/> renouncing Obedience to the Pope's Commands, do not amount to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his Power. This Gentleman makes two parts of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The firſt which he tells us is quite beſides the Queſtion, and ſo had great luck that it was not skipt over with its fellows, he contracts into theſe words: <hi>Either deny the Pope's Authority, or obey it.</hi> To this he ſays, That <hi>if thoſe good Subjects, who will ſwear they will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the King, though the Pope ſhould Depoſe him, will but ſay (though not ſwear) he cannot Depoſe him (which is no more than with the</hi> French <hi>Divines to deny the Depoſing Power) then the Gentleman</hi> (the Author) <hi>and the firſt part of his Argument are ſatisfi'd</hi> Not very well, I doubt, nor any body elſe, unleſs they mean as they ſay. For who ſays what he does not mean, will hardly paſs either for good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or good man. Their conſcience muſt either bear them witneſs, that the Pope indeed cannot Depoſe, or they cannot ſay ſo without ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and few people are ſatisfi'd with Lyers. But if their conſcience be in earneſt perſwaded ſo, manifeſtly it is not check of conſcience, which hinders them from doing all that the Oath of Allegiance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſwearing that it is ſo perſwaded. So that bare ſaying, if you bar lying, may prove as bad, and of as ſcurvy conſequence, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, and profeſſing, and trepan a man, before he be aware, into ſwearing.</p>
               <p>For my part I am wonderfully ill ſatisfi'd with all this, and ſee this offer to ſay, and refuſal to ſwear, with extreme grief. 'Tis well that all Catholicks are not of that mind. If they were, thoſe who think ill enough of us already, would ſoon think worſe, and take us for a ſort of people, who car'd not what we ſaid, or ſubſcribed, and who perhaps would profeſs for true what we thought falſe, and contrariwiſe, or never concern our ſelves what were true or falſe, as long as we were not put to our Oaths. None but Magiſtrates, or who had Power to adminiſter Oaths, would deal with us at this rate, nor they neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while. For he whoſe word will not be taken, will not long be believ'd upon his Oath. I hope, and doubt not but, this Gentleman is provided againſt this ſcandal. But I am ſure, if any Maximes would infer it, they are not Catholick Maximes. As I am only acquainted with common roads, and know nothing of the nearer ways of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſtry, I apprehend things in this manner. Words I take to be ſigns, and witneſſes to the hearer, of what is in the ſpeakers mind. Who puts into his words, what is not in his mind, wrongs his hearer and himſelf, and overthrows the Baſis of all human Converſation, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53776:44"/> Traffick, Veracity. Every honeſt man ſeems a kind of Peer in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What he ſays on his faith, (and this he does as often as he ſpeaks deliberately in a matter of moment,) is as guilty, or not guilty upon my honor.</p>
               <p>Swearing I take to add nothing to ſaying, ſave a ſtronger confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe, who not relying on our honeſty, require God ſhould be engaged, with whom, they think he muſt be madly wicked who dares diſſemble, ſince none can deceive him, nor hope to ſcape his ſevere hands. But there muſt be the ſame grounds for both, <hi>viz.</hi> Truth, or the things being in the words, as it is in the mind. Without this you cannot ſay, with it you may, in due circumſtances ſwear. Neither does <hi>ſwearing</hi> add or alter, nor <hi>ſaying</hi> diminiſh any thing of this, nor does <hi>ſwearing falſe,</hi> more wrong our Neighbour, though it does God and our ſelves, than <hi>ſaying falſe.</hi> Wherefore I cannot underſtand how any one can fear perjury, by ſwearing what he ſays, but he who has ſaid what is againſt his conſcience. For Perjury, as this Gentleman rightly obſerves, is nothing but a Lye ſworn, and ſo of neceſſity there muſt be a Lye before there can be Perjury. So that I ſee not how he who thinks himſelf in danger of Perjury, by ſwearing the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Depoſe, can avoid the danger of lying (damnable as well as the other, though not ſo grievouſly) by offering to ſay it. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt be ſafe in both caſes, or neither, and all the ſeveral ways of checks, which this Gentleman has found in his Second Chapter againſt <hi>Swearing,</hi> muſt as neceſſarily be avoided in <hi>Saying,</hi> unleſs a man care not to be damn'd, ſo it be not altogether with the deepeſt.</p>
               <p>For the Second, and only pertinent part of his Argument, he puts theſe words of the Author: <hi>What wiſe and real difference as to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the practical part of Human Life, is there betwixt theſe two; I'le ſwear never to obey my Commander,</hi> and <hi>I'le ſwear he has no power to command me?</hi> The anſwer, he ſays, is eaſie. <hi>The laſt is an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Oath, and ſwears to a diſputable piece of Doctrine as to an abſolute Truth, which is down right Perjury.</hi> This is ſtill the old Song, to the Tune of the whole Treatiſe, which what harmony it makes to my ears, I have often enough ſaid. I ſhall only obſerve it has ſomething a begging countenance, as well as its neighbors, while it aſſumes <hi>the Doctrine ſworn is diſputable.</hi> For the Author, he ſees, is of opinion, that forſwearing the Practice, amounts to forſwearing the Power, and puts the Queſtion, whether there be Power, or no, out of diſpute, ſo that the later is not diſputable to him who can ſwear the former.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53776:45"/> Again, This <hi>abſolute Truth</hi> is a ſuppoſition more than needs, or will, be granted. 'Tis as the Oath is. If it run as the Oath of Allegiance, Truth to the beſt of the ſwearers judgment will ſerve turn. And I conceive the Author, where he ſpeaks of <hi>true,</hi> meant no otherwiſe, it being ſo generally underſtood, and certainly meaning nothing elſe in our caſe. For what elſe is material, there will be occaſion to ſpeak of it in the next branch.</p>
               <p>Which, he ſays, <hi>being a promiſſory Oath, and tending wholly to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, engages not for the abſolute Truth of any Doctrine, but only for the ſwearers Allegiance and Loyalty, and therefore requires no abſolute certainty to build on, but only a ſafe and practically probable Opinion.</hi> That this is a promiſſory Oath I agree, that we may agree at leaſt in ſomething. But this promiſſory Oath, to my apprehenſion, does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for the Truth of ſome Doctrine, and if it did not, could not engage for the Allegiance and Loyalty of the ſwearer. As for abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Truth, and abſolute Certainty, which he puts in, ſuch an Oath as the Oath of Allegiance requires them not, ſo that if he had an eye to that, they are rubs which he has found out to caſt into a way, which was otherwiſe ſmooth. Let but his words and judgment agree; let him engage for Truth enough to ſatisfie his Conſcience, and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to anſwer for ſo much Truth, and he may ſafely take the Oath of Allegiance, for any thing more that it engages him to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of him. Taking Truth then for ſuch Truth as is requiſite to the Oath of Allegiance, I conceive, that he who ſwears <hi>he will never obey</hi> the Pope in the caſe of Depoſing, does as much engage for the truth of this Doctrine, <hi>That the Pope cannot Depoſe,</hi> as he who ſwears in the Terms of the Oath.</p>
               <p>And I am ſo perſwaded, becauſe I think it as much Perjury, or, if it have another name, as great a ſin, to ſwear what is <hi>unlawful,</hi> as what is <hi>falſe.</hi> I think alſo, that the lawfulneſs of what we ſwear, muſt be as much known, and fixt in our conſcience with as great a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Truth: and that the inward checks againſt Injuſtice, make a man as deeply accountable to God, as checks againſt F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lſity. Wherefore, unleſs he who ſwears, that he will always diſobey the Pope, be ſatisfi'd in his conſcience, that it is, and always will be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to diſobey him, I think he cannot ſwear. That promiſſory Oath therefore engages for this Truth, That <hi>it is always lawful to diſobey him,</hi> nor is there any difference whether he ſwear in the promiſſory, or aſſertory form. But it cannot be lawful to diſobey him, who has
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53776:45"/> power to command, nothing being more evident, than that ſuch power imports an obligation to obey. Wherefore he who expreſly, or virtually ſwears it is lawful to diſobey the Pope, ſwears alſo he has no power to command. Now he who takes the Oath of Allegiance does no more, and he who ſwears in the promiſſory form, to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion does no leſs. So that I cannot imagin how thoſe who refuſe the one, offer the other.</p>
               <p>But if there be a difference, as this Gentleman apprehends there is, and that the promiſſory Oath do not engage for any Truth, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, there can be no ſecurity of Allegiance by the Promiſſory. Every body knows, that who promiſes an unlawful thing, is ſo far from being oblig'd to keep his promiſe, that he is obliged not to keep it. And I ſpeak of Promiſe by Oath. If the Pope have power to command, diſobedience is plainly unlawful. Who promiſes to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, and yet allows that perhaps 'tis true that he has power to command, promiſes to do what perhaps is unlawful, and what he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges to be ſo. If any man's conſcience will allow him to make ſuch a promiſe, every mans judgment will tell him, that it can no more than perhaps oblige, and that perhaps who makes it, may be oblig'd to break it. Who thinks this a ſufficient ſecurity of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, may do ſo, if he pleaſes: but, I doubt, he will have a hard talk to make others think ſo. For the promiſer may perhaps be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd not to perform, and 'twill not be thought reaſonable the ſecurity of Princes ſhould depend on may-be's. For my part, I ſee not what can be plainer, than that, if unlawful promiſes are not to be kept, thoſe promiſes are only ſecure, where lawful things are promiſed. Wherefore who cannot, or will not engage for the lawfulneſs of what he promiſes, cannot engage that his promiſe ſhall be performed.</p>
               <p>I know not whether it may be ſaid, That <hi>'tis lawful to do what is not ſeen to be unlawful. And therefore ſince, whether the Pope have power or no, I do not ſee he has, it is lawful for me to diſobey him, and oblige my ſelf always to diſobey him by promiſe.</hi> But this will not do: becauſe I cannot oblige my ſelf for ever, nor for longer than till I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ignorance. As ſoon as I ſee the Pope has Power, my diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience becomes unlawful, and I am bound to break promiſe; my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance therefore evidently depends on my ſight. But I do not ſee what ſecurity I can give that I ſhall never ſee, what I confeſs perhaps is to be ſeen, and which may be ſeen, it may be the next day, it may be the next hour, after I have made the promiſe, for any thing I can
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53776:46"/> anſwer to the contrary. I fear in ſpite of whatever can be done to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, there muſt always be a tacit condition impli'd in theſe kind of promiſes, and that he who profeſſes abſolutely he will always be loyal, can mean no more than that he will be loyal, unleſs, or till it appear, that he ought not to be ſo. Which to me ſeems but ſlender ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Again, What appearance of ſecurity is there in a promiſſory Oath, which the promiſer acknowledges may be diſpenſt with? Though he ſhould ſwear not to accept of a Diſpenſation, the matter, I doubt, would not be much mended. For if there be a power to diſpenſe, and that power have exercis'd it ſelf, and diſpens'd, whether the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation be accepted or no, the Oath is truly diſpens'd with, and cannot oblige him who acknowledges it is ſo, as he muſt, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a power of validly diſpenſing. Wherefore if he accept not the Diſpenſation, 'tis not in vertue of the bond, of his Oath, for that is cancell'd, even in his own judgment, but in vertue of ſomething elſe: for which if he can offer other ſecurity, well and good; but his former ſecurity is void. There is no obligation from the nature of the thing: For Loyalty to Princes depos'd, is not to be preſerv'd, if the Pope truly can depoſe. There is no obligation from the Oath: For that may be diſpenſt with, and though it were not, as ſoon as it is ſeen that the Pope has power to depoſe, to obey a depos'd Prince is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and the obligation of the Oath ceaſes.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the caſe is hard. What is promis'd is unlawful, if the Pope can depoſe. No mans conſcience can be oblig'd to a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and his conſcience will not allow him to think the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depoſe. But yet becauſe he does not abſolutely ſee the Pope can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though he ſhrewdly ſuſpect it, and hopes he never ſhall, his conſcience will ſuffer him to promiſe abſolutely that he will always be loyal; though every body ſees, it may happen to be his duty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his principles, not to be Loyal. And ſo upon the matter he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires you to accept of his good will, for the deed, and to believe he will never do otherwiſe than he promiſes, ſince his conſcience is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with any obligation, that this will ſhall be conſtant. And when a man does all that he can do, why ſhould not people be ſatisfi'd? Now he whoſe conſcience is perſwaded that the Pope cannot depoſe, when he promiſes to be always loyal, is doubly oblig'd to performance; by his Oath, and by the nature of the thing promiſed, which obliges whether he promiſe or no, and therefore cannot be diſpenſt with.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53776:46"/>
               <p>In the laſt place he brings what he calls, <hi>A conjectural proof, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meer affirmative preſumption</hi> of the Author concerning our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. But he was a little out, when he took it for a proof. It is the Anſwer to an Objection, which the Author had fram'd againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nor do I ſee any great preſumption, in thinking our Anceſtors would have chang'd their judgments, if they had ſeen reaſon ſo to do. And I think the Reaſons alledg'd by the Author, and this Gentleman out of him, would have gone neer to have perſwaded them, not only that the opinion denying the depoſing power is bare opinion, but alſo that it is true. In which if I be guilty of preſumption too, I hope the ſin is not unpardonable: For I muſt preſume again, that He, and the Author were both miſtaken, if they thought our Anceſtors gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally refus'd the Oath of Allegiance. I am much miſtaken if they did not generally take it, though I foreſee there will be a fitter place, to ſay why I think ſo.</p>
               <p>There remains only to conclude a little differently from him, That ſince <hi>it is the Voice and Law of Nature, that Protection claims Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and that perfect Subjection to Civil Powers, under which we live, is the ſtrict Injunction, no leſs than dictate of Reaſon</hi> (he might have ſaid Religion too) there can be no danger to our Souls in complying with what Nature, Reaſon, and Religion require; nor danger of Perjury by giving ſecurity, that we will, as we ought comply; and that Tenets inconſiſtent with ſuch ſecurity, are inconſiſtent with all three, and can have no better warrant than ſcruple. Wherefore I wiſh and pray, That rendring to God the things that are Gods, be not made a pretence of robbing <hi>Caeſar</hi> of the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> nor our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to our King forfeited under a ſhew of Loyalty to God.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE Third Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Third Treatiſe: goes another way to the wood. Declining the Queſtion of the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, with the warineſs of the ſecond Author, and with more liberality allowing every one to hold and defend the contrary, It yet finds fault with the Oath of Allegiance, upon an extrinſical and accidental account, <hi>viz.</hi> the Popes prohibition of it. So that had the Pope either not writ, or not ſent the Breves alledged, there had been no place for this Gentleman's Argument. It is this: <hi>Whoever takes the Oath, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies an exterior obedience to the Popes prohibition, in matters appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, and no farther then they appertain unto him. But it is unlawful to deny an exterior obedience to the Popes prohibitions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining unto him, and no farther than they appertain unto him: Therefore it is unlawful to take the Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Argument the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Preface</hi> takes occaſion to tempt us into their example of throwing the Pope quite off, ſeeking with this pleaſant ſmartneſs to fright us into an apprehenſion that we ſhall have a hard task of it, to juſtifie the Popes Authority, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it at the ſame time. I muſt beg his pardon for that matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53776:48"/> that to cut off the Head is but a bad way to cure the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. All ſorts of Superiors, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, Supreme and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, exceed ſometimes, and find their Commands unperformed, not only without blame, but with praiſe. None but Tyrants expect their Word ſhould paſs for Law; All juſt Powers have their bounds. And I, for my part, think him much a better Subject, and more a friend, and ſupport of Authority, who, preſerving a due reſpect, refuſes to comply with the failings of his Superior's, than who with a dangerous flattery ſooths his Errors, perhaps into ruin. Beſides, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has ſhew'd us how to avoid the precipice, he has made it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the more inexcuſable to leap into it. Wherefore acknowleding the Popes ſuperiority, I muſt try how hard it is to anſwer the Argument drawn from it.</p>
            <p>Yet before I begin, I have ſomething to ſay to the Topick, which diſreliſhes with me for more reaſons than one. Firſt, I have ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to underſtand it, as plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> as it is. <hi>Exterior Obedience is due to the Popes Prohibition in matters appertaining to him, and ſo far as they appertain to him.</hi> What means this, <hi>ſo far as they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him?</hi> This ſhould ſignifie, becauſe Spirituals belong to the Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate, and Temporals to the Civil, that Spirituals may in ſome reſpect become Temporals, and in that reſpect belong to the Civil Magiſtrate, the Eccleſiaſtical medling with them no farther than as they are Spirituals. But then in that reſpect they are no longer Spirituals, and ſo appertain not to the Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate, and are excluded from his cognizance by the firſt Branch. So that what remains for the ſecond Branch to exclude or ſignifie, I cannot tell. Or may it mean, becauſe Magiſtrates are to exerciſe righteous judgment, that it does not appertain to them to judge wrong, and ſo they are to be obey'd only ſo far as they are in the right? If this be his meaning, his Argument, I doubt, will do him but little ſervice. The thing is not always true; for unjuſt Commands are ſometimes to be obey'd for the good of the community; and if they were not, he knows it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Command in queſtion is not juſt.</p>
            <p>But which is of more import, according to the Argument, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of taking the Oath of Allegiance conſiſts in Diſobedience to the Popes commands. And yet he ſays a little after <hi>N.</hi> 7. That the Popes Breves <hi>do not make the Oath unlawful, but only declare it to be ſo</hi> Which if it be true, then the Unlawfulneſs does not conſiſt in Diſobedience, but in the intrinſick Unlawfulneſs of the matter ſworn,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53776:48"/> and the Oath had been unlawful whether the Pope had forbid it or no. But if the Argument be true, and the Unlawfulneſs do indeed conſiſt in Diſobedience, then plainly there was no Unlawfulneſs antecedent to the Prohibition, which the Pope would declare, and the Breves make the Oath unlawful and nothing elſe. How theſe two can hang together, is very difficult to comprehend. One ſays the Oath is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe forbidden; the other, forbidden, becauſe unlawful. In the firſt caſe <hi>Prohibition</hi> is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Unlawfulneſs</hi> the <hi>Effect:</hi> in the ſecond, <hi>Unlawfulneſs</hi> is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Prohibition</hi> the <hi>Effect.</hi> To ſay both, is to make the ſame thing a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of that of which you make it an <hi>Effect,</hi> that is, both <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of it ſelf. As unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and as impoſſible as this is, I cannot blame the Author for deſiring two ſtrings to his bow, and the liberty to ſhoot now one Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, now another, as occaſion ſerves: but I foreſee 'twill be difficult dealing with ſuch a man. Shew the command obliges not, and the obligation of the thing commanded will be inſiſted on: ſhew there is no obligation in the thing, and the command will be obtruded. And who can ſpeak to more than one thing at once?</p>
            <p>Now for the Argument, which only preſſes the Command, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it quite changes the nature of the Queſtion, turning it from the <hi>thing ſworn,</hi> to the <hi>ſwearing,</hi> from the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of the <hi>Oath,</hi> to the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of <hi>taking it.</hi> As it is plainly one thing to ask whether Fleſh be a lawful food, and another, whether I may eat it on Fridays: ſo to ask whether the Oath be a lawful Oath, is very different from asking, whether I, in ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, may take it. Who inquires whether the Oath be <hi>lawful</hi> or no, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to know whether it contain any thing contrary to the Laws of God or Man, or no. Who anſwers of an <hi>External Prohibition,</hi> ſpeaks of a thing not contain'd in the Oath, and ſays nothing at all to the Queſtion. If I refuſe an Oath, who have bound my ſelf not to ſwear (ſuppoſing I can validly do ſo) or a <hi>Quaker</hi> refuſes one, whoſe conſcience permits him not to take any, I think it is ſtrange Logick which can from thence conclude that Oath unlawful. And I think it no leſs ſtrange to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Oath <hi>unlawful,</hi> becauſe it happens to be <hi>forbidden.</hi> For the Prohibition is as extrinſical to the Oath, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and the Unlawfulneſs of an Oath is underſtood to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical Denomination.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice required for one of the three conditions of an Oath, the want whereof he ſays <hi>N.</hi> 1. makes an Oath intrinſically evil, muſt, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53776:49"/> think, be meant of a Juſtice <hi>intrinſical</hi> to the Oath. For an <hi>extrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> injuſtice, ſure, can make it no more than extrinſically evil. And ſince, as he ſays, in the ſame place, an unjuſt Oath cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any caſe poſſible, this unjuſtifiable injuſtice cannot be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical Injuſtice by prohibition. Becauſe if that were all, the ſame Oath remaining the ſame, now might, now might not be juſtifiably taken, as it has the luck to be forbid, or not forbid; and might be taken by ſome, and not by others, as ſome might be forbid, others not forbid to take it. As in this caſe, the <hi>Breves</hi> being addreſt only to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there is nothing in the Argument which can hinder the <hi>Scotch,</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or any other of the Kings Subjects from taking the Oath of Allegiance. But an Oath truly unjuſt cannot be taken by any body at any time.</p>
            <p>Again, The juſteſt Oath in the World may happen to be forbid, as well as the moſt unjuſt; nor is it poſſible to frame an Oath, which may not become unjuſt this way. As in this very caſe, I believe it were hard to contrive a renunciation of the Depoſing Power, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which renunciation there are who will not be ſatisfi'd of our fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) into terms, which ſhould ſcape cenſure or prohibition. We have ſeen the experience in the <hi>Iriſh Remonſtrance,</hi> and in the <hi>Three Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi> (and I could inſtance farther if it were to purpoſe) which as free as they are from the Exceptions commonly made againſt the Oath of Allegiance, yet have not met with much better luck. So that I fear there is no fence for their Flayl, and ſhould we refuſe to give aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our fidelity (if that renunciation be indeed neceſſary to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance) till we could find out terms which ſhould diſpleaſe no body, I doubt it will be long before we paſs for faithful Subjects. However it be, this external caſual injuſtice, I conceive, is not that which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeek, and are obliged to avoid in Oaths. Not that diſobedience to obliging commands is not ſin, and ought not be avoided: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is a ſin of another nature than Perjury, if that be the name of ſwearing injuſtly. For though the Command happen to be about an Oath, yet it is but a Command, and the breach of it diſobedience, not that irreverence to God, which is committed by ſwearing falſe or unjuſt things.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon I ſuſpect the Topick will not prove very ſatisfactory to thoſe for whoſe ſake he profeſſes to write. Few are ignorant of the <hi>Breves</hi> he mentions; but they have a ſcruple concerning them, and deſire to know whether what they forbid, as contrary to Faith and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53776:49"/> Salvation, be truly ſo or no. Who would ſatisfie them, ſhould ſhew it is; For if it be not, in ſted of quieting their former ſcruples, they will be apt to entertain new ones, and deſire to know farther, what neceſſity there is of obeying a command, manifeſtly grounded on a ſuppoſition which is not true. This Author undertakes to lay theſe ſtorms of doubts, and allow them <hi>N.</hi> 80. the ſame liberty with the <hi>French,</hi> to <hi>hold,</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> the Pope has no power to Depoſe Kings, which is the ſubſtance of the Aſſertory part of the Oath, and <hi>N.</hi> 50. offers a promiſſory form, aequivalent, I ſuppoſe, in his meaning, to what is promis'd in it. This is manifeſtly to allow them to hold all, which they profeſs in the Oath to hold, and do all they promiſe to do. And yet, to ſatisfie them, He will not allow them to take the Oath, becauſe it is forbidden. Now their difficulty is, How they can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to profeſs by Oath, when legally required, that they hold what they do, and according to this Gentleman, lawfully may hold, and promiſe what, according to him, they lawfully may, and ought do. And his ſatisfaction to this difficulty is to tell them of a Prohibition, which Prohibition is the very thing in which they are diſſatisfi'd. It is plain the Oath was, or was not unlawful, before the Pope forbid it. Who believes it was, needs not the Popes <hi>Breves</hi> for his ſatisfaction. Who believes otherwiſe will be more apt to be diſſatisfi'd with the <hi>Breves,</hi> than the Oath, for all this Gentlemans Argument. For let the Pope have what power he will, why ſhould he uſe it to forbid things, which otherwiſe might irreprehenſibly be don, and this to the manifeſt and great prejudice of the obeyers? Till the World be a little better diſpos'd to blind obedience, ſuch Arguments, I doubt, will not be very ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in my opinion this Topick intrenches a little too much on the Reverence we owe the Pope. If no Unlawfulneſs can be ſhewn in the Oath, independent of his <hi>Breves,</hi> he is manifeſtly expos'd to the aſperſion of forbidding us lawful things. And that, not upon the ſcore of <hi>Unfitneſs,</hi> on which things otherwiſe lawful may rationally and profitably be forbidden; but of an <hi>Unlawfulneſs</hi> which this Gentleman allows us to believe there is not. I conceive, in a Country where all he does is ſo apt to be miſ-interpreted, it would have become the reſpect due to him, to have been more chary of his credit. If any can, it had been much more to purpoſe for this Author to have let his <hi>Breves</hi> alone, and produced that which would have done the buſineſs much better without them. Though Catholicks ſhould be ſatisfi'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53776:50"/> with them, Proteſtants, he knows, look upon what they forbid, as a duty required by the Law of God and Nature, beſides that of our Country. By this Gentleman's Argument, the Pope and we are both left in the lurch, and unable either to juſtifie him from the aſperſion of forbiding us to do our duty, or our ſelves from owning a power which can do ſo.</p>
            <p>Were there nothing elſe but bringing the Popes Authority into diſpute, I conceive, he had deſerved much better of him, if he had choſen another Topick. I, for my part, have a great averſion even from diſcourſing of Supreme Powers, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil; and doubt it is making more bold with them, than becomes private men. The Authors of the <hi>Second Treatiſe,</hi> and <hi>Controverſials,</hi> in my opinion, are in the right. To preſerve the Majeſty of both Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in an awful diſtance, is not only reſpectful, but neceſſary. And for the Popes Authority in particular, I muſt declare I think it of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite benefit to the World, and believe it may thank the prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeal of inconſiderate friends, if fewer be of my mind than ſhould be. For indeed to ſtrain Authority beyond its bounds, is the worſt office which can be don to it. In ſted of getting what is not due, it often loſes what is; as who would ſhoot farther than his bow will carry, by drawing up his Arrow too high, breaks his bow. I am very ſorry he has, by preſſing obedience, drove me to the neceſſity either of obeying againſt my conſcience, or giving a reaſon why I think I ought not, againſt my humor. Who is at the Oar, cannot but row; yet I ſhall endeavor to ſtrike no deeper, than is juſt neceſſary to keep the Boat ſtedy.</p>
            <p>To enter upon the merits of the Cauſe at laſt, The <hi>Major</hi> of his Argument is this: <hi>Whoever takes the Oath, denys an Exterior Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Popes Prohibition, in matters appertaining unto him, and no farther than they appertain unto him.</hi> Pray why ſo? How comes the Oath of Allegiance to appertain to the Pope? which if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a King, and a King who had the principal hand in making it,<note place="margin">K. <hi>James</hi> his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Oath of Alleg. <hi>p. 47.</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>meddles only with the civil Obedience of Subjects to their Soveraign, in meer temporal cauſes.</hi> Becauſe, ſays he, <hi>N. 2. Several things are contained, or involved in this Oath, the deciſion whereof appertains only to the Spiritual, and Eccleſiaſtical Court.</hi> If I am not miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Lawyers (for I have no skill in theſe matters) when there is queſtion to which Court a Cauſe belongs, the deciſion of that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, by the old Catholick Laws of <hi>England,</hi> belongs to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53776:50"/> Court. I know he is of another Opinion, for Reaſons which we ſhall ſee when we come at them. In the mean time I think the practiſe of our Anceſtors, in which the Spiritual Power has acquieſced, ought to over-rule his Reaſons. But this by the by; for I intend not to inſiſt upon it. What are theſe ſeveral things, which appertain only to the Spiritual Court?</p>
            <p>He reckons up theſe: <hi>How far the Spiritual Power extends it ſelf? What Authority Chriſt left to the ſupreme Spiritual Paſtor as ſuch? What are the effects of an Excommunication? What Propoſitions are Heretical? and,</hi> which he ſays is the main debate, <hi>Whether this Oath be ſinful or not?</hi> It is, I perceive, of main importance by which handle we take a thing. All this, as Eccleſiaſtically as it ſounds, has a pure temporal meaning. For what Spiritual <hi>Power,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Cenſure</hi> can do (which by the way are but three ſeveral expreſſions of one thing; 'Tis in ſhort <hi>Spiritual Power exercis'd by the Spiritual Governor</hi>) means nothing by its extent, and authority, and effects, but whether Subjects are to obey their Prince, when the Pope ſays they are not. And certainly the Queſtion of the Civil Obedience of Subjects, in civil matters, is a temporal matter belonging to the Temporal Court, and does not become Spiritual, becauſe a Spiritual Power interpoſes in it. It is what it is, whatever that be which medles with it; nor have I heard, nor can I imagin that Spirituality has the force to aſſimilate things into its own nature, like him who turned all he toucht to Gold.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the Oath ſays, the Pope cannot Depoſe, and that is to determin the extent of his Power.</hi> I cannot tell whether it be or no. He who ſays the <hi>Thames</hi> does not run over <hi>Salisbury</hi>-Plain, I think does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin the bounds of the <hi>Thames.</hi> But not to diſpute of words, if you will have it a confinement of his Power, it is ſuch a confinement as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Civil Power. For he who has it, as he is to be ſuppoſed ignorant in Spirituals, does not exerciſe any authority, or pretend to any skill in them: but out of the nature of Civil government, which belongs to him, and in which he alone is to be ſuppoſed knowing, ſees what is conſiſtent or inconſiſtent with it: and out of that ſight deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins what may indeed by accident concern the Spiritual, either power, or pretences, but which proceeds from his own skill in matters in which he alone has it. Barely by knowing what twenty ſhillings is, I can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tell, that if you add Gold, or take away Braſs, it is not twenty ſhillings; and yet I determin nothing of the value of either, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53776:51"/> know ſo much as what they are. So it is in this caſe. The Civil Governor knows what Civil government is, and by that knowledge can with certainty judge what is neceſſary for it. He judges, and all the World ſees he judges right, that it cannot ſubſiſt without the obedience of thoſe who are ſubject to it, in thoſe things in which they are ſubject; and certainly concludes, that what takes away that obedience, deſtroys the government. Whether it be Spiritual, or Temporal Power, or any thing elſe, which pretends to do this, is all one to him. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, he evidently ſees it ought not be done, and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is vain. Wherefore if you will call the denying of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the Spiritual Power, a confinement of the Spiritual Power, it is plain he exceeds not the ſphere of his own activity, nor does more than conclude out of the Principles of his own Art. And this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly belongs to him, and ſo to him as not to any body elſe; ſince every body elſe is ſuppoſed ignorant in them. Neither does he intrench upon the Spiritual Power, by ſecuring the ſubſiſtence of the Temporal Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Let me add, that 'tis as much for the intereſt of the Church, as of the Common-wealth, that he do ſo. A Common-wealth can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Church, but a Church cannot be without a Common-wealth. 'Tis true, the Church is the principal and more noble, as raiſing man to a higher and better ſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſpoſition to true and laſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; whereas from the Common-wealth he can only receive theſe periſhable conveniencies which are found in a peaceful ſociety. But yet the Common-wealth is to the Church as the Foundation to a Houſe. The Houſe is without doubt the principal part, by which thoſe of a Family have ſhelter from the weather, conveniencies to repoſe, and converſe, and what elſe they aim at in buildings. Yet nothing of all this can be without a firm Foundation; whereas the Foundation, however uſeleſs, would yet remain though the Houſe were gon. So it is between the Common-wealth and the Church. The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is the Foundation, without which there can be no ſuch thing as a Church. For the Church is a body of men to be rais'd by Chriſtian Diſcipline to the uttermoſt perfection of which humane nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. And 'tis evident there can be no Body of men to be <hi>rais'd,</hi> where there is no Body of <hi>men.</hi> Civil Government preſerves this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Take that away, and there is nothing on which the Church can work, and no where ſhe can be. The Common-wealth, however uſeleſs to the perfection of nature, would remain, though there were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53776:51"/> no Church; but Church can no more ſtand without Common-wealth, than the Chambers when the Foundation fails. So that manifeſtly the preſervation of the Church, and all the goods we hope from her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Common-wealth be kept up.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought it not amiſs to ſay by the by, that thoſe, who I doubt reflect not on it as it deſerves, may ſee there is nothing more ruinous to the Church, than that Zeal not according to knowledge, which ſeeks to exalt the Spiritual Power to the unſetling of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral. As fondneſs is a very dangerous, and often ruinous, kindneſs, Theſe by their over-friendſhip become in truth Enemies to the Church. In the mean time, I think, I may warrantably deny the <hi>Major</hi> of the Argument, ſince the wording of the Inſtances, which would prove there is ſomething in the Oath which appertains to the Pope, in ſpiritual Terms, does not hinder the matter of it from being a pure temporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, appertaining wholy and only to the Temporal Power, and not at all to the Pope.</p>
            <p>I ſay nothing of the other two Inſtances, becauſe I conceive them more for ſhew than ſubſtance. The Oath determins not what is, or what is not Hereſie; but barely calls that Heretical, which is already determined, and known, and confeſt by all the World to be ſo, as is already diſcourſed in anſwer to the Second Treatiſe. It is a very ſtrange pretence, that the Temporal Power exceeds it bounds, becauſe it calls things by their own names. Neither do I think this Author, or any body elſe, would think the Civil Power determin'd of Hereſie, or paſt its limits, or did any thing reprehenſible, if it ordered for example, that he ſhould be puniſht, who maintained this Heretical Propoſition, <hi>That Theft is lawful,</hi> or commanded it to be renounc'd. And this is as much as the Oath of Allegiance does.</p>
            <p>Then for the pretence of <hi>ſinful,</hi> or <hi>not ſinful,</hi> if this would draw the Oath under the cognizance of the Spiritual Tribunal, it would draw every action, and leave the Temporal nothing to do, abſolutely idle and uſeleſs. For there is no action which is not either ſinful or not ſinful. Our Bargains, our choice of Life, of Company, of Clothes; every thing we do, by this account would all croud into the ſpiritnal Court, becauſe, as I ſaid, in all we do well or ill. I think it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to dilate upon this point, though I know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pretence has been made uſe of before, and by a Pope too. But I conceive it finds no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good reception in the World, and believe every body may eaſily ſee why it does not. Suppoſe there were nothing of all this, where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53776:52"/> there is no Queſtion of <hi>ſinful</hi> or <hi>not ſinful,</hi> there is no place for the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the Spiritual Court: And whether Allegiance be lawful, and may be profeſſed, I hope is no Quſtion which needs, or can come under Cognizance. Wherefore the <hi>Major,</hi> I am perſwaded, ought not be admitted without better proof.</p>
            <p>Yet though it were, I do not think any thing would come of it. In rigour I need ſay no more, the Argument being ſufficiently anſwered, when one of the Premiſes is deni'd. But yet I cannot but ingenuouſly declare my thoughts, and ſay, that to my apprehenſion the <hi>Minor</hi> will not hold water neither. 'Tis this: <hi>But it is unlawful to deny an exterior obedience to the Popes Prohibitions, in matters appertaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and no farther than they appertain unto him.</hi> This Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I conceive, is not true, becauſe I think there goes more to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, than barely to conſider to whom the Matter of the Command appertains. The <hi>Manner</hi> of Commanding, or applying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is to be thought of as well as the <hi>Matter</hi> commanded; and the <hi>Uſe of the Power,</hi> as well as the <hi>Power.</hi> For to begin with the later, What if the Commander abuſe his Power, and command things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, or poſſibly deſtructive? What if he command Vice, and forbid Vertue? If you ſay the Pope is ſtill to be obey'd, becauſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice are matters properly appertaining to him; you open a gap to all the abuſes to which the frailty of humane nature is ſubject, and plainly put it into the Power of one man (and who ſhall ſecure us, there ſhall never be found one wicked enough, to have the Will too?) to bring all into confuſion and ruin. In ſhort, You oblige us to what cannot be don, and which we are fore-warned not to do, no not by the Authority of an Angel from Heaven. I forbear to dilate this Topick, and give it that frightful face which it would have, if the number and weight of inconveniencies were particularly inſiſted on. Appeals <hi>as from Abuſe</hi> are things ſo common, and ſo notorious, that I think this ſhort hint is as much as needs to my purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But yet it will not be amiſs to look upon it with reference to our preſent caſe. The Pope has declared the Oath of Allegiance cannot be taken, as containing many things contrary to Faith and Salvation, and upon that ſcore forbidden it. Suppoſe he had don quite contrary, declared the refuſal of it contrary to Faith and Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allow'd, or commanded it. I would ask this Gentleman, Whether he, who upon the warrant of that ſuppoſed declaration ſhould take the Oath, would not do a thing contrary to Faith and Salvation, if the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53776:52"/> Oath indeed be, according to the <hi>real</hi> declaration, contrary to them? As likewiſe, whether he, who upon the warrant of the <hi>real</hi> declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refuſes the Oath, does not act contrary to both, if the refuſal truly be, according to the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> declaration, contrary to them? I think neither of theſe can be denied, ſince matters evidently are what they are, whatſoever be declared concerning them. Wherefore I ſee not but a caſe may poſſibly happen in which our Salvation may be prejudiced even by Obedience; and if it may, ſure care ought to be taken that it be not. For to have ſo much care of Obedience, as to have none of Salvation, is what I cannot believe God expects at our hands. I conceive therefore it imports as much, in this power of the Keys, that they be turned the right way, as put into the right Lock. Otherwiſe inſted of opening the Gates of Heaven, they may chance to double lock them.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader expects not I ſhould digreſs into the examination of circumſtances required to juſtifie Diſobedience. That Queſtion concerns me not at preſent. For having only to do with the general Propoſition, that Diſobedience is unlawful, whenever the Matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the Commander, I conceive it is enough to ſhew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not true, if it may happen that Obedience is not due; And 'tis plain, that Obedience is not due, if the Power of commanding be abuſed to the prejudice of Salvation. Who ſhall be Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be or no? and the like matters concern me not, and require more exact treating than can be expected in a digreſſion. I ſhould think the Caſe muſt not need a Judge: Particulars certainly not being at liberty to obey or diſobey, on pretence of their private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Manner</hi> I ſaid was to be conſidered as well as the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For the Obedience due from Catholicks to the Pope, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of the ſame nature with that which Religious perform to their Superiors. Theſe inquire no farther than whether the thing commanded be truly commanded or no, and when they know their Superiors will, which way ſoever they come to know it, obey without more ado. 'Tis not ſo betwixt Catholicks and the Pope. They obey him as a Magiſtrate, whoſe Commands, unleſs they come to them in a legal way, they neither do, nor are bound to take notice of. 'Tis not a bare knowledge of his will, how unqueſtionable and how undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoever it may be, which obliges to Obedience. People may, and often do, know very certainly of Decrees made by him; and know too,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53776:53"/> that he intends, and declares by theſe Decrees to bind the whole Church, and yet regard them not; and this unblamably, till they be propoſed in that manner, in which the cuſtom of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> requires they ſhould be propoſed.</p>
            <p>This conſideration of the <hi>Manner,</hi> I ſuſpect will ſeem ſlight enough to ſome who have not thought of it, and who perhaps will be apt to imagin, that, provided the Pope have commanded any thing, and we know he has don ſo, it matters not much which way we come by that knowledge. And yet all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> thinks it, and really it is a matter of great importance; ſo great, that, except in caſes where Salvation is manifeſtly concerned, and which a body would think are known enough, not to need new Commands, The Pope can hardly make a Command, the good of obeying which can anſwer for the harm of obeying it, when unduly propos'd. For what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting of Bulls, and Letters, what cheats might not be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us at a diſtance, where people would rather chuſe to accept of any thing at a venture, than run to <hi>Rome</hi> for more certain informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt on this; it is a plain caſe, that what is to Edification in one place, may be to Deſtruction in another. Different Countrys have, and cannot but have different Exigencies. If the ſame Laws ſhould oblige every where, ſome muſt of neceſſity be obliged to what is harmful for them. Wherefore we ſee the Providence of God has ſo ordered his Hierarchy, that particular Countrys have particular Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Governors of their own, who living upon the place know beſt what is convenient for it, and are oblig'd to a care of their charges by the account which they are to make to God for them. The Pope has power over the whole; but ſo that he exerciſes it not (except where he is both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Biſhop and Prince) but by means of this ſubordinate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Authority. When he orders any thing, the Order is firſt brought to them. If they ſee fit they propoſe it to the people under their care; if they find it otherwiſe, they let it alone. Private men are guided by their determination; and what knowledge, or certainty ſoever they may otherwiſe have of the Popes Decrees, neither need, nor do take notice of them, till they be propos'd in a legal way by their own immediate Superiors. Thus has the Church been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the beginning of Chriſtianity, and thus it is governed at this day. Who would go about to alter this courſe, would abſolutely deſtroy the Hierarchy, introduce an Arbitrary Power, and ſet up an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53776:53"/> Univerſal Biſhop in that heretical ſence which St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſo much abhorred, and ſo ſtrongly oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the intermediate Eccleſiaſtical Authority, without whoſe concurrence, and much leſs againſt it, the Popes Commands have no obliging force, there is alſo in Catholick Countrys required the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Civil. And this with great reaſon, and for the good even of the Church. For as Eccleſiaſticks are ſuppoſed ignorant in the Art of Temporal Government, and what is neceſſary for the good of the Common-wealth, and beſides are not exempt from humane frailties; They may happen, on both accounts, to order ſomething prejudicial to Civil Government, without which nevertheleſs, as has been ſaid before, the Church cannot ſtand. For this reaſon Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Decrees are communicated to the ſecular Magiſtrates, and till they get the <hi>Placet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>Exequatur,</hi> or <hi>Verification,</hi> or in whatever phraſe they uſe to expreſs their allowance, from them, no Decree of the Pope can be propos'd, and bind the people. I cannot anſwer my information of the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is ſo exact, that there is no place wherein it is not otherwiſe; but ſure I am, it is ſo in many. Our unhappy differences in Religion indeed make this impoſſible to be practis'd in <hi>England;</hi> yet theſe differences hinder none from owing as much ſubjection to the Civil Power, as if there were none, and as much duty, and ſollicitude for the good of the Kingdom. Since we are not fortunate enough to be guided in theſe matters by open decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the pleaſure of the Civil Power, as we otherwiſe would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ought to be, our Conſciences, I conceive, ſtand charged, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no Eccleſiaſtical Commands which thoſe Conſciences tell us are againſt the good of the Kingdom. For whereas we have not the publick Judgment to direct us, there is no remedy, that I know, but to ſupply the defect as well as we can by our private one. And moſt evidently the Civil Government muſt be preſerv'd entire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can any Eccleſiaſtical Authority oblige a man to any thing contrary to it.</p>
            <p>To apply what has been ſaid to our caſe: The Pope has declared the Oath of Allegiance contains things contrary to Faith and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this we are firmly perſwaded he is miſtaken. Indeed while he declares not what theſe things are, we are left in the dark, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether the miſtake be of <hi>Fact,</hi> or <hi>Right.</hi> If he thought his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> his <hi>power of Excommunication,</hi> or any other point of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53776:54"/> Faith is deni'd by the Oath, as was apprehended by the firſt writers againſt the Oath, and thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi> too, who in likelihood beſt knew the Popes thoughts, 'tis a miſtake of <hi>Fact:</hi> For not only no ſuch thing is deni'd by the Oath, but particular care was taken there ſhould not. If he thought his Depoſing Power, the disbelief whereof is ſworn by the Oath, a point of Faith, the miſtake is in <hi>Right:</hi> That Doctrine being ſo far from Faith, that it has openly been declared <hi>erroneous,</hi> and <hi>contrary to the Word of God,</hi> by thoſe whom all the World, and the Pope himſelf acknowledges for good Catholicks. But though it appear not which way he underſtood it, 'tis cleer he was miſtaken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
            <p>Now, when the Pope uſes his Power to propagate a miſtake, and a miſtake of this conſequence, which would make us take for contrary to Faith that which is not ſo, I think there is a plain abuſe of his Power, and which ought not be obey'd. We are taught by a Maſter, in whom we are ſure there was no miſtake, that the Church has no power to <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> let the matter be what it will, <hi>none againſt Truth, but for it.</hi> What the Pope has declared is againſt Truth, and is to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For ſince Faith is the foundation of all Chriſtian building, there can be no greater, nor more palpable deſtruction, than altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith. And to accept as contrary to Faith, what is not ſo, is plainly to alter Faith. It will not ſerve turn to ſay, that ſo we obey, we may believe what we will. For though in Metaphyſical ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, there be a difference betwixt <hi>Obeying,</hi> and <hi>Believing,</hi> and that difference be in ſome caſes material enough; yet here, where we are therefore commanded to refuſe the Oath, becauſe it contains things contrary to Faith, to obey that Command is, in moral eſtimation, to acknowledge that in truth it does ſo. And this is plainly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that our Faith is other than it is. Scholaſtical diſtinctions will not carry it againſt common ſence, which will undoubtedly judge thoſe, who refuſe the Oath on this account, do believe the Pope has power to Depoſe, and as Faith too, if not-depoſing Doctrine be contrary to Faith. For as the World is now, there lies the whole ſtreſs. The other Queſtion <hi>of Fact,</hi> which at firſt made ſome noiſe, being, ſince it has been better lookt into, quite ſilenced, and upon the matter yielded.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, They would do well to conſider what they do, who urge Obedience upon theſe terms: Go about to bring a new Faith into the Church, and which is more intolerable, a falſe one:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53776:54"/> Leave Catholicks expos'd to the inexcuſable ſhame of being blindly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to all commands, whether conſiſtent, not only with civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but even with Chriſtianity, or no: Give the Adverſaries of the Church a manifeſt and eaſie victory over her Advocates, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to defend either Her or Themſelves. Without more ado, it is to ruin the Church, to ſet open the Gates of Hell, and aſſiſt them to, what ſhall never be, their prevailing againſt her. And theſe are the conſequences of an undiſcerning Obedience to all the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, even in matters appertaining to him. When people are gravely and emphatically exhorted to be humble and obedient, not to truſt to their deceitful Judgments, to ſacrifice the nobleſt of their faculties, their Will, to hearken to the voice of their ſupreme Paſtor, with the reſt of thoſe ſpecious Topicks which may eaſily be aſſembled, it works wonderfully with pious ſouls. But if theſe fine pretences lead us at laſt to deſtroy Faith and the Church, God preſerve me from ſo miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a piety. I think all the World agrees there is no obedience due to <hi>Clave erranté,</hi> and I am ſure the ſame Apoſtle who has taught us there is no power in the Church againſt Truth, and to Deſtruction, has pronounced an Anathema even to an Angel from Heav'n, if he ſhould teach otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, How the <hi>Breves</hi> in queſtion have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome to our knowledge. And it is plain they have not been ſo propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as according to the practice of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> they ſhould, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come binding. All has paſt in a private way, by private intelligence, private diſcourſes and letters of private men, without the interpoſition of any publick Authority to apply the Popes Authority to us. Who thinks this ſufficient to oblige us to obedience, ſhould do well to reflect on the ruinous confuſion ſuch an obligation would bring into the Church, which I have briefly toucht before. If you ſay <hi>this cannot be don, becauſe ſince our unhappy differences in Religion, we have no publick Eccleſiaſtical Authority among us, and therefore we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch knowledge as we can have.</hi> This, inſted of concluding we ought to obey theſe <hi>Breves,</hi> concludes rather we cannot be obliged to obey any. For which way ſoever it happens that the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are not legally intimated, whether by misfortune, or fault, or what accident you will, ſtill it remains, <hi>no legal intimation, no neceſſity of Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That thoſe who are not of our Communion ſhould fancy ſtrange things of our ſubjection to the Pope, and think his word paſſes for Law
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53776:55"/> among us without more ado, I wonder not; Few live in Catholick Countrys, and fewer mind what paſſes there. Their miſtakes, almoſt in all that concerns us, are ſo frequent, that there is no room for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. But that thoſe who have lived perhaps a good part of their time amongſt Catholicks, and cannot but take notice of what is daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their eyes, ſhould have the like conceits, is very ſtrange. It ſeems as if they fanci'd the World a Monaſtery, and the Pope Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prior, and no more in the buſineſs, but <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Do.</hi> Alas! there is no ſuch matter. Our obedience to the Pope is very different from Monaſtical. A Canonical obedience we ow him, a ſubmiſſion to his commands legally intimated. This legal intimation implys the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the intermediate, ſubordinate, Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and the Civil too, where that is concerned; and where it can be had, which becauſe here it cannot, we muſt of neceſſity take upon us a little more than would be fit in other circumſtances; and remembring we are accountable to God for any harm which befals our Country by our means, uſe our beſt judgments to keep our accounts clear. More obedience than this I do not think any Catholick ows, nor any Country, out of his own Territories, pays.</p>
            <p>It would be ſomewhat a ſurprizing thing, if the Popes Authority ſhould become greater in <hi>England,</hi> by the change of Religion. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I hope, will have ſome more love to their Country than to make that unhappineſs the ſtep to another, by bringing it into an Arbitrary ſubjection, ſuch as was not acknowledged in Catholick times, and is not acknowledged in any Catholick Country beſides, and which, if it were, would be the ruin of the Hierarchy. For my part I do not ſee how the Popes Commands can oblige thoſe who have no immediate Eccleſiaſtical Superiors, otherwiſe than in vertue of the good of the thing commanded, of which thoſe deprive themſelves who refuſe to obey the command. Otherwiſe, when the frame of Government is taken away, 'tis, I think, as 'twas before it was ſetled. Things are in a kind of ſtate of Nature, where Reaſon is the only guide. This indeed will teach them to obey any thing beneficial to themſelves, and not prejudicial to their Country, and the Civil Government. That being ſafe, which no Eccleſiaſtical Authority can violate, whatever contributes to a conformity of manners, and diſcipline, as much as the ſtate of things will bear, with the reſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> with whom they hold communion in Faith, is undoubtedly to be deſired and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. But how he can govern by way of Authority, where that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53776:55"/> Authority cannot be duly appli'd, I can no more underſtand, than how fire can burn the wood which it never comes neer. Where He would govern in that manner, He ſhould provide ſubordinate Paſtors, by whoſe means and aſſiſtance He may govern. Difference of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no bar to this. For Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline has been preſerv'd, and as good, if not better, Laws made under Perſecution, as ſince; Perſecution much more ſevere than, thanks be to God, has been, or is likely to be in ſo merciful a Climate as <hi>England.</hi> To go about it otherwiſe, is, I think, to go to work without Tools.</p>
            <p>But to let this paſs, and return to the neceſſity of Publication; who thinks the Popes commands oblige to obedience without it, when it cannot be had, let him tell me, why the <hi>Venetians</hi> pleaded againſt the Popes Interdict, that it was not publiſht, when themſelves had hindred the Publiſhing? Let him tell me, why the Enactive part, as he calls it, of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> obliges not us, or the <hi>French</hi> who will not publiſh it. For the difference between <hi>Enactive</hi> and <hi>Declarative,</hi> of which he afterwards ſpeaks, hinders not the matter enacted from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Council. I hope a Pope and a General Council are ſomething more than a Pope alone. What they have enacted is known with as much certainty at leaſt, as that the Pope has forbid the Oath of Allegiance. And yet becauſe that knowledge is not come in a legal way, by which way it is impoſſible it ſhould come when people will not, or cannot publiſh what is enacted, no body thinks their Decrees obliging, no not this Gentleman himſelf, who makes this Argument. How we ſhould come to be obliged by the unpubliſht Breves of a Pope, who are not obliged by the unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht Decrees of a General Council confirm'd by the Pope, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, I think, a very ſtrong paſſion againſt the Oath of Allegiance to unriddle.</p>
            <p>And yet, though this be abundantly ſufficient, there is ſomething more in the caſe. Bare want of due publication for want of due Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not all. There was plain refuſal of publication by ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority<note place="margin">Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſundry Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Exam. 5. July 2. 1607.</note> as was. At that time there was an Arch-Prieſt here, one <hi>Blackwel;</hi> To whom the firſt Breve which forbad the Oath was ſent. <hi>Blackwel</hi> would not publiſh it, and though challenged both at home and from abroad, and greatly blamed for his pains, yet perſiſted in his reſolution, and could not be brought to it. Letters were contrived and ſent abroad in his name to that purpoſe, (For the importance of publication it ſeems was well enough underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) But he diſowned,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53776:56"/> and declared them counterfeit. On the contrary, he both took the Oath himſelf, and by Letters to his Aſſiſtants, perſwaded them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example, and alſo to inſtruct the Laity to do ſo too. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Breve came a while after, but not to him. This made no change in him. For he writ again both to the Clergy and Laity, repeating his former Admonitions. And this is what was don at that time. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been don ſince, that I know, by any who have had any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Authority here.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is plain theſe <hi>Breves</hi> have not the force which they might have had even in the preſent ſtate of things. Had thoſe, who have that ſuperiority which is among us, concurred with the Pope, and required obedience to his <hi>Breves,</hi> the Topick would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a little more ſpecious. But while that is wanting, it is very unreaſonable to exact obedience upon the ſcore of Authority, when there is not ſo much as Eccleſiaſtical Authority enough to require it. And when there is, it will be as unreaſonable to follow Eccleſiaſtical Authority <hi>Clave errante,</hi> againſt the commands, and to the prejudice of the Civil Power. However, we ought at leaſt be let alone till that day come, there being no colour to inſiſt upon Eccleſiaſtical Authority, when it is not appli'd to us as it ought, and might be even in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances, and as actually it is appli'd when it does any thing with us. We obſerve Holy days according to a Conſtitution not long ſince made at <hi>Rome,</hi> of which had it not been as authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as it could be, recommended at home, no body needed, and I believe few would have taken notice. In ſhort, to perſwade us that a Bul, or Breve from <hi>Rome,</hi> no otherwiſe intimated to us than by the private aſſurance which private men give of them, oblige us to obſerve whatever they order, is, under the ſpecious pretext of obedience, to put a yoke upon our necks, which neither our Fathers have been, nor we are able to bear; to alter the Government of the Church conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from the beginning of Chriſtianity to this day; and which I ſee not how he can be either good Patriot, or good Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately inſiſts on.</p>
            <p>What I have alledged is, I think, no news to any body. Yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may not be amiſs, by a freſh Example or two, to ſhew, that Catholicks actually do proceed, as I have ſaid. And I will chuſe them from thoſe very Popes whom this Gentleman has alledged. The firſt is <hi>Paul V,</hi> who when he ſent his firſt Breve hither, was in the height of his famous conteſt with the <hi>Venetians.</hi> That Quarrel
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53776:56"/> in ſhort was this. The <hi>Venetians</hi> had made, or renewed certain Laws,<note place="margin">Hiſtoria partico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare delle Coſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate tra'l S P. Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo V. e la Seren. Rep. di Venetia.</note> which the Pope judged contrary to Eccleſiaſtical immunity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by way of Juſtice againſt two of the Clergy, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not ſubject to the Civil Power, and only accountable to the Eccleſiaſtical. The Pope ſent Breves to them, as he did to us, in which he declared, according to the ſtile uſed with us, that the matters aforeſaid, as being to the damnation of their Souls, ſcandal of many, and contrary to Eccleſiaſtical liberty, were null and invalid; Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them to conſider the danger of their Souls, and under Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication commands the Laws to be recalled, and cancelled, and the Priſoners delivered up to his Nuncio, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>reat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing alſo to proceed farther in caſe of diſobedience.</p>
            <p>This, upon the matter, is our very caſe; ſave that with the <hi>Venetians</hi> The Pope proceeded ſomething more ſeverely, joyning actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and farther threats to the diſobeying his commands. Otherwiſe there are Breves in both caſes, and from the ſame Pope, and thoſe Declaratory, and in matters, which according to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, appertain to him, the ſalvation of Souls, and Eccleſiaſtical li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not obey them, and, the Pope proceeding to Interdict their Country, ſuffered not that Sentence to be publiſht, and continued the uſual publick exerciſes of Religion. It was feared the buſineſs might have come to Arms; but ended in a Treaty; by which the <hi>Venetians</hi> delivering up the Priſoners to the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador, in gratification of his King, and with a proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of preſerving their right to judge Eccleſiaſtical perſons, were without more ado re-admitted to their uſual good correſpondence with the Pope, though poſitively refuſing to accept of Abſolution, or ſo much as a ſolemn Apoſtolical Benediction, for fear it might ſhew like one. Here, I think, was plain denyal of External Obedience to the Commands of the Pope, in matters, according to this Gentleman, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to him, and no farther than they appertained to him; and this in the face of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and by perſons, who, when the heat was a little over, were by the ſame Pope, who commanded both them and us, acknowledged for very good Catholicks, and by all the World beſides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Urban</hi> VIII, the other Pope mentioned by this Gentleman, had a<note place="margin">Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio di D. Victorio Siri Tom. 2.</note> difference with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> a feudatory of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, after ſome monitories not obey'd, came to an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and 'twas expected an Interdict would follow. The Duke, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53776:57"/> what the Regulars might do in ſuch an occaſion, ſent the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners out of his Countrys; and ſignifi'd to his own Subjects, that ſuch a Sentence being feared, thoſe who were perſwaded they were obliged to obey it, ſhould have free liberty to depart, before the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence were iſſued; but if they ſtaid till it came out, They ſhould be puniſht if they obeyd it. They all promiſt, and that in writing, he not being content with bare words, to ſtand faithfully by him. Only the Jeſuites, for the example they had given at <hi>Venice,</hi> were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the reſt. They apprehending the conſequence of this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, made an addreſs of themſelves, and expreſſing much trouble for having been paſt by, made<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> voluntary proteſtation of continuing firm to the Intereſt of the Duke. And were afterwards obſerved to be the moſt eager of all in perſwading the people not to value the Decrees of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, this caſe is not altogether of the ſame nature with the former, the Quarrel being about temporal matters, and betwixt a Vaſſal and the ſupreme Lord. Notwithſtanding when it came to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, it was taken out of the hands of Temporal cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, and the Pope proceeded not as Lord, but as Pope, puniſhing the Sinner with the Spiritual ſword, not the Vaſſal with the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And he, I ſuppoſe, in this Gentlemans opinion is to judge with which ſword he ought to ſtrike. However, the matter appertained to him one way or other; and here again was a denyal of external obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his commands, abetted by all the Clergy of his Dominions, and the Jeſuites moſt of all. It were eaſie to heap up multitudes of the like Inſtances; but I confine my ſelf to the two Popes which were concern'd in the Oath of Allegiance. This Gentleman ſhall, if he pleaſe, tye us to no ſtricter rules of obedience, than are acknowledged in other places, and permit his native Country to enjoy a freedom unblamable even in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf. In the mean time, upon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Jeſuites of <hi>Parma,</hi> and all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> beſides, I likewiſe deny the <hi>Minor</hi> of his Argument, conceiving it appears very plainly that <hi>it is not</hi> always, nor particularly in our caſe, <hi>unlawful to deny an exterior obedience to the Popes Prohibitions in matters appertaining unto him, and no farther than they appertain unto him.</hi> Sure he muſt have a ſtrange pique to the Oath of Allegiance, with whom an Argument againſt it will reliſh, where nothing aſſumed is true. For neither does the matter of it appertain to the Pope, nor if it did, were obedience due to the Breves inſiſted on.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53776:57"/>
            <p>I fear I ſhall be thought to have dwelt too long upon this Argument; and yet in the variety of matter, which the ſubject offered to my thoughts, I have left more than I have taken, and perhaps bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>We next meet with Anſwers to ſuch Objections as the Author thought fit to make againſt himſelf; with which to meddle at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is more than needs. For ſince the Argument, by which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove the Oath unlawful, is anſwered, there is no neceſſity to examin how he has behav'd himſelf in anſwering the Arguments of others. Nevertheleſs, becauſe diverſe things are woven into his diſcourſe, which ſeem to have ſome force, and may be thought to have more, if they be balkt, I will not, to ſave a little pains, give occaſion of ſaying, that any thing which is conſiderable is diſſembled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. He objects againſt the Breves, <hi>That they are of no force in</hi> England, <hi>without the Kings approbation, according to Statutes made in Catholick times.</hi> This Objection reaches not the caſe. The Breves want not only Civil, but Eccleſiaſtical approbation too, and would be of no force though they had it, ſince they are prejudicial to Civil Government, which no Eccleſiaſtical Authority can infringe. Beſides, the liberty of Nations does not depend on Laws. They have it from Nature, before and without Laws. Every Nation united into a Government, has power to preſerve that Government. Neither are the Laws alone to be conſidered, which they make upon occaſion to ſecure their Liberties, but the power they have to make ſuch Laws, and add, and alter as they ſee fit. I conceive therefore the Freedom of <hi>England</hi> is not to be determined barely by the words of Statutes. While it remains a Nation united into a Politick Government, it is, and muſt be free from all obligation of ſubmitting to any thing contrary to the good of the Common-wealth. Thoſe Statutes did not create the freedom of <hi>England.</hi> They were only an exerciſe of it, and the ſame freedom which was uſed in making thoſe Statutes, may be uſed in making others. Though none at all had been made, the Liberties of a free Nation cannot be denyd her. I think it then very little to purpoſe, to amuſe our ſelves with examining whether the words of Statutes be expreſs to the point or no, while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is neither good <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good man, who receives any thing prejudicial to the good of his Country, or acknowledges a Power which can oblige him to do ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore leaving him the ſatisfaction of expounding the Statutes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53776:58"/> as he pleaſes, in which yet I ſuſpect few of thoſe, whoſe trade it is to expound them, will agree with him; and reſerving the ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he makes of forbearing the Oath, (as if it were a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to refuſe to give aſſurance of Allegiance) to the place in which he promiſes it ſhall appear: I ſhall only ſtop at the Second Anſwer which <hi>N.</hi> 7. he gives to the Statutes, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Breves Enactive, but not of Breves Declarative.</hi> Enactive Breves he calls thoſe, whereby ſome new thing is ordained, relating to the external Government of the Church: Declarative, whereby a Doctrine is declared falſe, or action ſinful.</p>
            <p>This, as I formerly hinted, unſays all that was ſaid before. For ſince the Breves do not <hi>make,</hi> but only <hi>declare</hi> the Oath unlawful, the Unlawfulneſs of the Oath is not to be taken from the Breves, but from that unlawful thing, whatever it be, which is declared by the Breves, and the Argument is out of dores. The truth is, we run round. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ask, <hi>Why the Oath of Allegiance may not be taken?</hi> This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man undertakes their ſatisfaction, and anſwers, becauſe it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Why unlawful?</hi> becauſe forbidden. But <hi>why is it unlawful not to obſerve that Prohibition?</hi> becauſe the thing forbid is unlawful, and <hi>only declared to be ſo</hi> by the prohibition. And thus we dance in a circle. All this might have been ſaid plainer, and ſhorter, The Oath is unlawful, becauſe it is unlawful. For if it be unlawful, becauſe forbid, and forbid becauſe unlawful, as evidently as can be, 'Tis unlawful, becauſe 'tis unlawful. However, becauſe this Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ill as it agrees with its fellows, may yet be thought to have ſome force in it ſelf, it will not be amiſs to ſpend a little time upon it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I would gladly know, what unlawfulneſs that is, which there was in the Oath for the Breves to declare, and which they have declared. This Author when he was upon the point, and had made it his buſineſs to ſhew it, either could not find, or at leaſt thought not fit to mention any other Unlawfulneſs, than that of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now it ſeems that's not the thing; there is an unlawfulneſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the Prohibition, which the Breves only have declared. Why then, in behalf of thoſe for whoſe ſatisfaction he profeſſes to write, I intreat him to ſhew us this Unlawfulneſs, becauſe This, and This alone will be to our ſatisfaction. For every body is ſatisfi'd that unlawful things are not to be don; but every body is not ſatisfi'd, that all Breves are to be obeyd. On the contrary, the World is generally
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53776:58"/> agreed, that Breves are not to be obeyd, but in circumſtances which want in our caſe. But till this be don, people will always remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfi'd, becauſe if after ſo much time, and ſo much earneſtneſs uſed in this buſineſs, no ſuch thing do appear, there will be reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no ſuch thing which can appear, and that there was a miſtake in the Breves, and the Declaration not warranted by Truth. As the temper of the World is, I doubt people will not be overmuch ſatisfi'd with theſe, who would inforce obedience to ſuch Declarations. Had this Gentleman thought he could have diſcovered this ſecret, I ſee no reaſon in the World he had to keep it a ſecret, and amuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and us with topicks more ſubject to diſpute than the matter which he would clear by them, and in which too he has the conſent of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt him. At leaſt, methinks, he has no reaſon to ſay there is ſomething unlawful in the Oath, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the Breves, unleſs he could tell us what this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is.</p>
            <p>In the next place I would fain underſtand what priviledge <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Breves have beyond <hi>Enactive,</hi> and what greater neceſſity of obedience they carry with them. Either this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> or <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> are much out. For <hi>Withrington</hi> tells us theſe Breves are not to be obeyd, for this very reaſon, becauſe they are Declarative, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to gather his concluſion from the Doctrin of <hi>Suarez.</hi> It ſhould ſeem by this Gentleman, that they are to be obeyd for the ſame reaſon, becauſe they are Declarative. It is ſomething odd that the I, and the No, ſhould both be pretended from the ſame ſingle Term, <hi>Declarative.</hi> But, I think, this is not the only thing in which theſe two Authors diſagree. We ſhall ſee what <hi>Withrington</hi> has to ſay for himſelf by and by. In the mean time I would weigh the reaſon which this Gentleman has, for what he ſays, if I could find any. For he barely tells us, that the Statutes are not to be underſtood of Declarative Breves, and that theſe Breves are Declarative, and then leaves us to imagin there is ſomething of importance in this <hi>Declarative,</hi> which we may find out of our ſelves if we can; for we have no aſſiſtance from him.</p>
            <p>For my part, if a Declarative Breve ſignifie barely, as he ſays it does, a Breve which declares concerning a Doctrin or Action, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagin what other obedience can be given to it, than ſubmiſſion of the Underſtanding, and believing the Doctrin or Action to be as it is declared. Now Obedience, I had thought, belongs to Action,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53776:59"/> and relates to the Will, not Underſtanding. Or if he will have Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the Underſtanding, it is certainly an interior Obedience, which if he require, I know not wherefore he talks of exterior Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience all along. And yet his Inſtance from the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhews as if he expected we ſhould believe the Pope, as we do the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. But I had thought, the caſe had been ſomething different be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Canon of a general Council, and a Breve of a Pope, even Declarative. We receive the declarative part of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe the Faith written in our hearts before the Council, bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, and becauſe there needs no new Authority to oblige us to hold and profeſs our Faith, which is commanded by an Authority ſuperior to all other, the Authority of Chriſt himſelf. And becauſe general Councils cannot be ſuppoſed to ſwerve from this Faith, we have the ſame obligation to receive what they declare concerning Faith, which we have to profeſs our Faith. Otherwiſe in matters which have no neceſſary connexion with it, we make as bold with a Council as the Pope, as this Gentleman acknowledges in the Inſtance. Wherefore unleſs he will maintain Inerrability in the Pope as well as Councils, I ſee not how our receiving the Declarative part of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> infers Obedience to Declarative Breves.</p>
            <p>The more I reflect, the leſs I underſtand how <hi>Declarative</hi> Breves come to be more efficacious than <hi>Enactive.</hi> Since <hi>Declaration</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a clearing of ſomething, theſe <hi>Breves,</hi> to deſerve the name of <hi>Declarative,</hi> ſhould clear ſomething, which <hi>Enactive</hi> do not, by which clearing they come to have more force. What may it be which theſe. <hi>Breves</hi> have cleared? If you ſay the Popes judgment; you make no difference betwixt them and <hi>Enactive.</hi> For in theſe too the Popes judgment is clear, and ſo all <hi>Breves</hi> would be <hi>Declarative.</hi> But the Popes judgment being one thing, that of which he judges ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one would expect by a Declaration, that the thing of which he judges, and which he declares, ſhould be made clear. That which he has declared here is, That <hi>there are many things in the Oath contrary to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith and Salvation. Many</hi> is plainly a multitude of <hi>Ones,</hi> ſo that ſome One muſt be contrary, if many be. Notwithſtanding this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and the Popes Judgment, it is ſo far from clear, that any one is contrary, that there is no Propoſition in the whole Oath, which we may not, according to this Gentleman, unblamably hold and maintain. This I gather from his permiſſion, <hi>Num.</hi> 80. to hold and maintain the <hi>French</hi> Doctrin, that the Pope has no power to depoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53776:59"/> Kings: becauſe the reaſon he gives for this fits all the reſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Author of the firſt Treatiſe ſays, That if this be not one, there are not <hi>Multa</hi> in the Oath, to which the Popes cenſure is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly applicable. Now would I fain know how it can be clear that the whole is naught, when it is not clear but every part of that whole is good. This is rather inextricable confuſion than clearing, and I ſhould think the direct contrary follows from what this Gentleman pretends. For ſince, according to his ſecond thoughts (for his Argument went quite another way) our obligation of obedience depends upon the Declarative vertue of the <hi>Breves,</hi> and we are bound to obey only where there is clearing; where there is no clearing, as here there is not, we are not bound to obey. If he will ſay we are bound, becauſe the Popes judgment is clear, then we are always bound, in <hi>Enactives</hi> as well as <hi>Declaratives,</hi> and the diſtinction between them is frivolous, as to the obligation of obedience. Only it ſeems to follow from meer Power in <hi>Enactives,</hi> and from Infallibility in <hi>Declaratives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the truth is, the Popes Infallibility lies at the bottom of all theſe kind of diſcourſes. People are ſometimes ſhy to acknowledge it, becauſe it reliſhes not well, as being a point unmaintainable in it ſelf, and pernicious and deſtructive to the Church, by bringing in a new Rule of Faith, and that even to the abetters, <hi>Incertain;</hi> in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, <hi>Falſe.</hi> But yet there is nothing to be don without it. For if the Pope may be miſtaken, there is no neceſſity that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be oblig'd to be miſtaken for company. However, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it unneceſſary to ſpeak to that point, while this Gentleman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly waves it by inſiſting only on exterior obedience; and beſides by allowing us to hold and maintain the contrary of what we conceive is declared. When he thinks it fit to put it upon that Iſſue, we ſhall ſee what proofs he will bring; in the mean time there is no reaſon, that I perceive, for the efficacy which he would perſwade us there is in Declarative Breves, but that, (which whether he will inſiſt on here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, I know not) at preſent he thought it better to give none at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Withrington,</hi> for his part, diſcourſes in this manner: He borrows from <hi>Suarez</hi> the notions of <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> and <hi>Declarative</hi> Precepts, underſtanding by the former, ſuch which create a new Right, or Rule of action, and making what they forbid unlawful in vertue of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, and which before was lawful: by the latter, ſuch which do not make, but ſuppoſe the thing forbid unlawful in vertue of a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53776:60"/> former. Law, confirm'd and declared by the new Precept. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs there were a former Law, and an obligation in vertue of it, He gathers there can be none from the new; it being the nature of a Declarative Precept, not to indure a new Right, or Rule of action, but purely to declare the old. Now the Pope declaring there are many things in the Oath contrary to Faith and Salvation, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forbidding the Oath, the obligation to obey this Prohibition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the truth of the declaration. If the Oath be indeed contrary to Salvation, people are obliged to refuſe it, in vertue of that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, though no Declaration, or new Prohibition had been made. If it be not, the Declaration is null, and no body obliged by it. Thus does <hi>Withrington</hi> endeavor to ſhew the Breves are not obliging, for the very reaſon for which this Gentleman would make us believe they are, becauſe they are Declarative; with this advantage in the conteſt, that at leaſt he gives a reaſon for what he ſays.</p>
            <p>In what he ſays <hi>N.</hi> 8. That it cannot prudently be thought the Statutes, he mentions, were intended by the Catholicks who made them, for ſuch times as ours; I conceive, he is in the right, becauſe, I conceive, they never thought of ſuch times; or if they did, had more prudence than to think their Laws would ſignifie much in them. But I ſee not what 'tis to purpoſe, ſince the liberty of Nations depends not on Statutes, but on that Power which makes Statutes. Neither can I apprehend what ſervice he will draw from the caſe he puts. For ſince Obedience in circumſtances is, by his ſuppoſition, not required by Law, there can be nothing but Reaſon which obliges the Subject to it, and ſhews him it is his duty in that caſe to proceed without Law. And ſo we may and do obey the Pope in what Reaſon ſhews us is our good; but can have no legally authoritative obligation, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of implicite obedience put upon us, where the frame of legal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is broken.</p>
            <p>This conſideration unriddles what follows in the two next Numbers. We may undoubtedly receive from the Pope any thing to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and no diſadvantage of any body elſe, nor can any Laws hinder us from doing our ſelves all the good we can. So we preſerve that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with him which is neceſſary for our Spiritual concerns, not purely in vertue of a neceſſary obedience to what comes from him, but becauſe what comes is beneficial, and we ſhould deprive our ſelves. of that benefit, by rejecting all things. But becauſe out of the force of Reaſon we accept what is advantageous to our ſelves, and not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53776:60"/> to our Country, it follows not we can have things put upon us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to our ſelves, and prejudicial to our Country; or that by the loſs of Religion we have loſt the freedom of a Nation, and all power of judging whether what comes from him be for our good or no.</p>
            <p>For what is ſaid <hi>N.</hi> 11. of the difference betwixt a Prince in, and out of communion with the Pope: It is true, we have the misfortune to want that publick rule of our Actions, which thoſe have, who live under Princes of the ſame communion. For the judgment of thoſe who are entruſted with the care of the common good, ought to guide thoſe Subjects who can have notice of it, and who are to examin no farther whether the Popes Orders be fit or unfit, than that they are approved or diſapproved by them. But where that cannot be had, there remains nothing, that I know, but to ſupply that misfortune by a greater diligence, and when any thing comes which is againſt the good of our Country, to remember we muſt anſwer to God if we contribute to the harm of our Country; and that our fault is the more unexcuſable, ſince there is no obligatory Authority on which we can diſcharge our Conſciences. For my part, I think, the going about to ſubject our Country to an unexamining neceſſity of Obedience to whatever Commands come from <hi>Rome,</hi> a very great inconvenience to it, and ſuch a one as, however others may ſatisfie their Conſciences, I ſhould be ſorry ſhould be found in my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>I would not meddle with what he ſays in the laſt place about Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ſince he confeſſes himſelf, that care was taken it ſhould be no part of the caſe, and content my ſelf with praiſing the Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which he concludes, if it did not embroyl the matter, and go about to perſwade us, as if ſubmiſſion of the offendor to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication either were, or at leaſt were thought neceſſary by ſomebody to the validity of it. That I believe is a conceit which has not entred into many heads, and the truth of the buſineſs, I take, to be this: The Pope may Excommunicate any Chriſtian, even a King, ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore if an Excommunication come againſt a Subject, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Statute warrants the examination of it, and if it be found againſt it, the ſuppreſſion.

That the Reaſons one may ſeem to have againſt the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees out of Council, cannot juſtifie refuſing exterior compliance with them, but only may give ground to make addreſſes,</hi> I conceive he indulges a little too much to his fancy, ſpeaking more according to what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends<note place="margin">Alex. 3. ad Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiep.

For people uſe not to obey, as long as they think they have reaſon on their ſides; and to expect they ſhould do otherwiſe, is to expect they ſhould act againſt their Reaſon. And this is both a judged caſe by the practiſe of the Chriſtian World, and has the warrant of an expreſs Text in the Canon Law. <hi>Aut man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum noſtrum reverenter adimpleas, aut per literas tuas, quare adim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plere

            <p>I conceive alſo, the Queſtions of the Fallibility of the Pope, and Infallibility of Councils, concern us not much. He is in the right, when he denies Infallibility is neceſſary in Superiors to bind their Subjects to Obedience; nor is it want of that, but want of due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which the Pope can exerciſe his ſuperiority, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Breves efficacious. Infallibility indeed is neceſſary to oblige us to inward aſſent, and when he ſtrains upon the Declarative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Breves, and makes them purely Declarative without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on, or mentioning the annexed Command, he drives it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſent, how much ſoever he diſclaim it elſewhere. Otherwiſe, when we ſee Laws changed every day, and ſometimes with no change of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I cannot perceive any ground to require Infallibility in Law-makers.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Popes capacity of being miſinformed, and the pretended miſtakes in this matter, he ſays, <hi>N.</hi> 8. That if after ſo much time, and ſo much diligence as the Pope aſſures us he has uſed, ſuch pretences be allowable, all Decrees whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil might be rejected upon the like. To deal ingenuouſly, I ſhould be of his mind, if there were nothing but pretence of miſinformation in the caſe; I mean of what was ſaid or don on both ſides. But, I conceive, whether his information in theſe matters were right or wrong, he is not to be obeyd, for reaſons which I have mentioned too often to need repeating.</p>
            <p>I conceive alſo, that the Pope was not rightly inform'd of the merits of the cauſe, and that we are not bound to take his word, though he ſay he was, which I do not know he has. As much and as materially as this Gentleman ſays <hi>Withrington</hi> has writ, I do not think he will become ſurety for the Pope, that he ever read any of his Books. At leaſt, for my part, I do not think he has leiſure to read one Book of a hundred even of thoſe which are dedicated to him. Thoſe who did read <hi>Withrington,</hi> in all likelihood informed the Pope, according to the Ideas which they framed themſelves. What theſe are we ſee in their Writings; if I could think them true, I had not now been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering this Treatiſe. If he was inform'd by them, and by whom elſe he ſhould be inform'd, I know not, I muſt needs think he was miſinformed, and perſwaded to take that for Truth, which was not.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53776:62"/> And ſo muſt every body think, whoſe judgment cannot acquieſce in his Declaration; nor is there any poſſible way to take this flea out of our ears, but to ſhew us which thoſe many things are, which according to his Declaration, are contrary to Faith and Salvation. For while we are perſwaded there are neither many, nor one, it is not poſſible but we muſt be perſwaded he was miſinformed, who ſays there are. This, if this Gentleman pleaſe to do, he may prevail to have it thought there was no miſinformation or miſtake in the caſe: but to leave this plain and eaſie way (for what can be eaſier than to aſſign one of many) and think to aw people out of their judgments by a reverend ſhadow of Authority, is to ſhew a great deal of good will to have the work don, and bring no tools to do it. It is in ſhort to ſay; My Maſters! pray do as I would have you, though I cannot, or will not, tell you why you ſhould.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of the 19. Conſideration belongs to the <hi>Major</hi> of his Argument, and has already been ſpoken to. In this place it will be enough to obſerve, that as it does belong to the Pope to determin of matters concerning Faith and Salvation, ſo it belongs to him alſo to determin rightly, and does not belong to him to oblige all the World, purely in vertue of his determinations, to accept of them whether right or wrong. In two words, this exterior compliance (the ſoft gentile phraſe into which he has ſhifted the more rugged term Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) which he requires, muſt either be due upon the ſame ſcore of <hi>Authority,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Infallibility.</hi> If Obedience be urged to <hi>Authority,</hi> as to a Magiſtrate whoſe Commands, even, though unfit, are often to be obeyd for the good of Government: This plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the circumſtances of a Magiſtrate, that there be a ſetled frame of Government, for whoſe ſake we ſhould obey. All the Pope does in the Church is by moving the ſeveral wheels which make up the great Machine; where there are no wheels, how he can turn them, is for this Gentleman to make out. The Government of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſubordinate, not only Miniſters, but Governors, by whom the Pope may govern, and who ſo derive his Orders to the ſeveral parts, that they judge themſelves whether they be to Edification <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and refuſe ſuch as are not. Without this the Church would no longer be a Hierarchy, but a Deſpotical arbitrary diſorder. If the pretence be from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> we ſhall gladly harken to any body who brings it; but hitherto our Reaſon tells us, that what is required, is againſt the rights of our Prince, and good of our Country, and ought not be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53776:62"/> obeyd, though both Eccleſiaſtical Powers ſhould joyn to urge it. And for <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that requires more than exterior compliance, more than this Gentleman thinks to ask, and more than he would yet if he ſhould.</p>
            <p>The following Conſideration juſtifies the contrivance of the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in groſs, without deſcending to particulars, and this both by Reaſon and Example. The Reaſon, methinks, is pleaſant. <hi>It would not,</hi> he ſays, <hi>be Prudence to deſign always the particular Propoſitions for which a Pamphlet is forbidden, when they are ſcandalous and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</hi> If Prudence be not always ſo ſevere, why might it not have been a little indulgent in this particular, and treated the ſolemn Act of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſome more condeſcendence than a Pamplet? But to let this paſs, what neceſſary point of Prudence obliged the Pope to leave us in the dark, and at liberty to hold and maintain a ſcandalous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Propoſition, not to be ſcandalous and offenſive? For this we may do, according to this Gentleman, of every Propoſition in the Oath. The worſe the Propoſition is, the more need, one would think, people have to be warned particularly of it, and the more care taken, that they miſtake it not for a good one. Sure this might have been don without any great note of Impudence. Beſides, how will this be applied to our caſe? Is there any thing ſo ſcandalous and offenſive in the Oath, that Chriſtian ears will not bear it out of the Oath? Every body ſees all that is there, and more ſcandal than they have by that ſight, they will not eaſily take by a new one. Some ſcandal, perhaps, might be avoided, if any body happen to miſtake ſome Propoſition for ſcandalous which is not; but how any ſhould be given by being informed which in particular is ſcandalous, is paſt my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, He is in the right, that ſuch Prohibitions are ordinary enough, and the cuſtom is reaſonable enough in many caſes. A Book may be ſo bad, that to deſign all, would be to tranſcribe the whole Book. Particulars may otherwiſe be ſo known, that they need not be mentioned. But beſides what may be alledged in this kind, where the Authority which forbids any thing is ſuch, that Obedience is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely due to it, whether it aſſign any reaſon or no, bare ſignification of its pleaſure ſerves turn without more ado. But the caſe is not ſo with the Pope out of his own Territories. In other places he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force nothing without their conſent. And if they be preſt to conſent, and no body will tell them why they ſhould, Obedience cannot well
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53776:63"/> be expected, at leaſt will be ill performed. For, I think, no Nation in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> obeys upon other terms. So that where the obligation of Obedience depends on the ſight of what is ſcandalous and offenſive, as in this it ſeems to do, to refuſe to ſhew it, is to leave them at liberty to diſobey.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when a Book is condemned in groſs, the particulars for which it is condemn'd, are known to thoſe who condemn it, unleſs they do they know not what; and ſo may be ſhewn if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Unleſs, perhaps, it be condemn'd for treating of a forbidden ſubject, or coming out contrary to order, or ſuch like reſpects not pertinent to our purpoſe. A body would think here is occaſion enough: the importance of the thing, our duty to God and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſo many conſciences in ſo important a matter, and what elſe would readily occur to one who would ſtay to conſider of it. In ſo long time, and after ſo earneſt endeavors, as have been uſed to this purpoſe, nothing does appear. What can be thought but that there is nothing, and that there are no particulars worthy of condemnation, which make up this condemnation in groſs.</p>
            <p>By his 21 Conſideration, it ſhould ſeem the point of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is that which ſticks with this Gentleman. If it be ſo, I wiſh he had made the moſt of it, and ſtood to it, that we might have ſeen the utmoſt, and either received or given ſatisfaction. By the ſhort hints he gives, we may rather gueſs there is ſomething which troubles him, than well underſtand what it is. But ſince it is not for me to mannage his difficulty, I can only obſerve what he ſays. Firſt he asks, <hi>Whether to take the Oath, be not implicitely to deny the Pope has Power to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate an Heretical King,</hi> and then preſently waves the point, remembring, I ſuppoſe, that he had ſaid a little before, that K. <hi>James</hi> would not ſuffer it to be put into the Oath. This, I think, is to put a ſcruple into our heads, and leave it there to work if it will. For barely to mention a thing of ſuch importance, is enough to make us ſuſpect there is ſome reaſon for it; elſe why ſhould it be mention'd? And then to fly off, and ſay nothing to it, is not to ſhew much care of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. All I can ſay, is, That there is no manner of ground for this ſurmiſe, and that, as he acknowledges, particular care was taken there ſhould not. Could any thing be made of it, I ſuppoſe, he would not have left it ſo.</p>
            <p>But he ſeems to ſtand to it, that the Oath denys <hi>an Excommunication of ſuch a King would have thoſe effects which are aſſigned in Scripture,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53776:63"/> viz. <hi>to deprive him of all Civil communication with others,</hi> &amp;c. And it is true, that the Oath does deny Excommunication would have any effect, with relation to our King, prejudicial to his Soveraignty, or the duty of his Subjects. But I did not expect this knot ſhould be found in the Ruſh by him, who, if I miſtake him not, offers as much to the full in this point, as the Oath requires. For he freely offers, <hi>Num.</hi> 50. to bear true Allegiance to his Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by whomſoever any thing be attempted againſt him, and under what pretence ſoever. I underſtand, and ſo, I think, does every body who reads this, ſince the Pope is one perſon who may attempt againſt the King, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication one pretence which may be made uſe of to ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that by this clauſe, Allegiance is ſecured againſt both. Which if it be, I ſee not how he can quarrel with the Oath for requiring that which he freely offers to do of himſelf.</p>
            <p>As for what he argues from Scripture, I doubt all is to be underſtood of our own communion, where when any one falls into ſcandalous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and will not be reclaimed by fraternal Admonitions, we are taught to avoid his converſation, and by all our carriage, teſtifie an averſion for his ſin. And this for two reaſons: That we be not infected our ſelves; and that the Offendor may be mended, and ſhamed into repentance. Yet this ſeems to be reſtrained to our own communion, The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. taking care they ſhould not underſtand his Doctrin generally. <hi>I mean not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Fornicators of this World: or the Covetous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>otherwiſe you ſhould have gon out of this World: But if He that is named a Brother</hi> be guilty, then not ſo much as to Eat with him. The <hi>World</hi> is by Interpreters underſtood in contradiſtinction to the <hi>Church.</hi> And ſo <hi>Eſtius</hi> gathers, that in Heretical Countrys the converſation of Hereticks is not to be avoided, farther than as the Law of Nature obliges us to preſerve our ſelves as much as we can from hazard. And ſo I believe this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtands it: For ſure he often ſays <hi>Ave,</hi> and eats with ſome who come under the heads mentioned in Scripture, and evidently he muſt, as the Apoſtle ſays, go out of the World to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo, as, with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, I conceive it is, there is no Uſe for this Doctrin in a communion ſetled into a ſtedy oppoſition of the Church, nor has it any thing to do with our caſe. But whether ſuch a Communion be to be underſtood by the word <hi>Mundus</hi> or no, I ſee plainly, that carrying our ſelves towards ſinners, as the Scripture directs, is quite a different thing from denying them what is their due. The Actions mentioned in Scripture are ſuch as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53776:64"/> are otherwiſe at our own choice. We may Salute, and Converſe, and Eat with whom we pleaſe, and we may let any of them alone when and where we pleaſe. In Actions only of this nature we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to behave our ſelves as our own and our neighbours good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; but that this Carriage ſhould deſpenſe with Juſtice, there is no ground to imagin. For can we think the Apoſtle meant, if a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of ours become a ſinner, we muſt not therefore pay our debts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not an honeſt man, turn diſhoneſt for company, and make his ſin a pretence to ſin our ſelves? We are taught elſewhere, <hi>to render all men their due, Tribute to whom Tribute, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Honor to whom Honor.</hi> Shall we believe all this is unſaid again in the places mentioned by this Gentleman? This too is ſpoken with relation to Princes, as certainly nothing can be more, nor ſo much, due to private men as Allegiance to them, becauſe no private good can hold compariſon with the good of the whole. Now a Prince is a Prince, whatever the man be: whether in, or out of communion of the Church, he is ſtill Prince. And ſince 'tis to the Prince we ow Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, I ſhall not be perſwaded the Scripture warrants us to bate any thing of that debt, till I am perſwaded that Scripture does or can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I take the whole Objection for a ſlip of fancy, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any thing which ſeem'd to make againſt the Oath of Allegiance, and not much minding what would come of it. Otherwiſe this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſure does not mean all he ſays. For who believes indeed, that Excommunication deprives a Prince of all civil communication, even that which is neceſſary to exerciſe his Office of Prince, and will ſtand to it, that this is a kind of Depoſing, (as is ſaid here, and, as in truth it is, ſince a Prince cannot govern without civil communication, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning being a communicating his Orders) muſt alſo ſtand to it, that the Pope can Depoſe. Nothing is more evident than, that if Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating and Depoſing be all one, who can Excommunicate can Depoſe. Who believes this has indeed reaſon to check at the Oath of Allegiance; nor can I ſee, how he can ſatisfie his conſcience, to profeſs Allegiance to ſuch Princes, or which way hope to perform it. For ſome communication is certainly neceſſary for that purpoſe. If, perhaps, a formal ſentence be thought neceſſary in his judgment, and ſo he can do well enough with his conſcience while that is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; an Allegiance grounded on ſuch a perſwaſion can laſt no longer than till the Sentence comes. And how ſoon he may be declared
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53776:64"/> to be out of communion, who already is ſo, who can tell? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, perhaps, is the formality of a ſentence ſo very neceſſary. For what great need is there that a man who himſelf profeſſes, and all the World knows, is not of ſuch a Church, ſhould with ceremony be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared not to be of it?</p>
            <p>Yet I ſhall not preſs theſe conſequences upon this Gentleman, becauſe whatever be in his words, I hope there is no ſuch thing in his meaning. Elſe ſure he would not permit us to hold, that the Pope cannot Depoſe; and 'tis very certain he will not permit us to hold, that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Excommunicate. I ſhall only intreat him to ſuffer me to take the meaning of the Scripture from the Example of a great Saint, rather than his conjecture. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had occaſion to practiſe this Doctrin with the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and he did practiſe it ſo as to obtain the end, <hi>confound him into Repentance,</hi> without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Authority or any exerciſe of it. I am of opinion, that who would hope for the ſame ſucceſs, would do well to go the ſame ways; other, I think, were neither meant by the Apoſtle, nor likely to do any good.</p>
            <p>After all, when this Gentleman confeſſes, that <hi>ſome Excommunicate perſons are excepted from theſe effects, either by the Popes indulgence, or otherwiſe,</hi> He ſays, I think, enough to anſwer the difficulty. Not to meddle with the Popes Indulgence, a head which affords matter enough of diſcourſe to one who loved talking; Who can be meant by his <hi>Otherwiſe,</hi> if not Princes, on whom, if Excommunication ſhould have the effects he mentions, there would remain no Subject to which the Pope could do good by Excommunication, or any thing elſe. For the Temporal Government preſerves the matter, on which the Church can work, and Princes preſerve Temporal Government. Put Excommunication to have effects deſtructive to the neceſſary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Princes, and by it you deſtroy all the good the Church can do, by taking away the ſubject to which ſhe ſhould do good. For evidently to nothing, no good can be don. And ſo we ſee in Wars, and thoſe confuſions which attend the ruin of Common-wealths, there is no place for Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, and the benefit to be had by it, the people by disjoynting the frame of ſecular Government, being rendred uncapable of the ſpiritual. Wherefore, who ever elſe be meant by <hi>Otherwiſe,</hi> Princes are certainly excepted from theſe effects of Excommunication which this Gentleman, I conceive, rather fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than believes: And this by the exigence of Nature, and the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53776:65"/> of Mankind, and the neceſſity of a ſubject for the Church to work upon, beſides the expreſs commands of God, without ſtanding in need of the Popes Indulgence.</p>
            <p>I paſs by the 22 Conſideration of the Popes being party in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as an Objection which, leaving others to the liberty of their Judgments, I, for my part, think of little value. What he ſays in the next, of the Popes not proceeding according to the Canons, I do not well underſtand. If he mean of Canons preſcribing what the Pope is to obſerve in order to his own reſolution, He may have proceeded according to the Canons for ought I know. And becauſe I know nothing to the contrary, I ought and do ſuppoſe he has, ſeeing that whether he have, or no, is little material. If he mean of Canons which preſcribe what is neceſſary, that the World be obliged to obey what he has reſolved, the proceeding in our caſe is not according to the Canons. For if the meaning of theſe Canons may be known by the practiſe of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which, I think, can neither be ſuppoſed univerſally ignorant of them, nor univerſally to contradict them, ſomething is required by them to Obedience, which whether it <hi>can</hi> or no, moſt certainly <hi>is</hi> not found in our caſe. How much ſoever the Pope muſt be his own Judge, if he judge contrary to what all the World ſees, all the World will ſee he is miſtaken in his judgment. But pray where is this ſufficient declaration he talks of, that the Pope has proceeded according to the Canons? I mean as is before explained. There is not a word in either <hi>Breve</hi> to that purpoſe, that I ſee. As far as I can underſtand, the <hi>Breves</hi> are not ſufficient for that of which they do ſpeak. How they ſhould be ſufficient for that of which they do not ſpeak, is ſomething harder to underſtand, unleſs a <hi>Declaratory Breve</hi> be all-ſufficient, and can do every thing.</p>
            <p>The 24. Conſideration lays diſturbance of the Church to the charge of the Defenders of the Oath, becauſe if they would be quiet, we might live in peace. As if we ſhould not live as much in peace if the Oppugners would be quiet. Why are not the Oppugners as great Diſturbers as the Defenders? Becauſe <hi>the Oppugners have not printed any thing for a long time.</hi> Is the Printer the only Diſturber? 'Tis Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I think, which makes, or is the Diſturbance; and there needs no printing to make Oppoſition, as long as we can ſpeak and write. Diſturbances are ſomething more ancient than Preſſes, in the World; could I hope they would ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe together, I wiſh with all my heart the Trade were loſt. In the mean time, I have not printed, I have only
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53776:65"/> writ what is printed, ſeems an odd ward to put by the thruſt of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance. Theſe things which diſturb me to anſwer, had never been printed ſure, if they had never been written; nor can I think the hands which carri'd them to the Preſs, were the very firſt into which they came. I know not what more they can do, now they are printed, than they did before in Manuſcript. If he who prints muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who writes will hardly ſcape altogether free.</p>
            <p>I know not, but methinks the caſe is this: The Showr falls. Thoſe who have Cloaks put them on, and keep themſelves dry. Thoſe who have none, and will get none, not to be out of faſhion, would perſwade the former to throw off their Cloaks, and be wet for company. And becauſe they find them not altogether ſo great Courtiers, a little reſty in that point, blame them for diſturbance. As if another muſt needs be diſturbed, becauſe I wear ſuch Cloaths as I have. And yet peradventure he has more reaſon, than who is diſturbed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I follow my conſcience. For this will never be out of faſhion: Cloaths may.</p>
            <p>But to leave Metaphors, and look upon things as they are; The Oath of Allegiance is cauſe of all. For I will go no higher, to ſearch into the cauſe of the Oath, though I have no reaſon to fear an Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But to begin there: This Oath is not to be charged either upon the Oppugners or Defenders, as being Antecedent to both, and an Act of others, in which neither of us had any ſhare. I, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is perſwaded I lawfully may, go and take this Oath. Do I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb any body by ſo doing? I do not perceive how any man can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be diſturbed, becauſe I obey the Law, when my conſcience tells me, I may and ought. You call me Heretick for my pains, or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, or Diſobedient. Truly I cannot help being diſturb'd at this, and believe there are few honeſt men who can bear the imputation of a Knave without diſturbance. I endeavor to free my ſelf from this imputation, and make it appear I am not an Heretick, nor a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, nor Diſobedient. And becauſe I do ſo, you ſay I diſturb the Church. This is juſt, The Child is beaten, and crys, and diſturbs the Houſe; and this diſturbance muſt be imputed to the Child, becauſe, if he would hold his peace, all would be quiet. And that is true; but who can expect a Child ſhould not cry when he is beaten? Truly we Defenders are in a ſad caſe, if we muſt be Hereticks if we hold our tongues, and Diſturbers if we ſpeak. But I ſhall never believe the Church is or can be diſturbed by an unoffenſive Defence. On the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53776:66"/> contrary, I have a very wrong Idea of her, if ſhe do not take it well, and is glad when any one can make out his Innocence: nay, though he could not, Endeavor to appear not-criminal will never paſs with her for a crime. For the Oppugners, if their peaceable ſtars will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any diſturbance ſhould be attributed to them, I will not go about to croſs their lucky influence. Let them ſatisfie their own conſciences as well as they can. All I ask is, that they would leave us quiet in the ſatisfaction of ours.</p>
            <p>But in reality, All depends on the Truth of the Queſtion betwixt us, and the ſight of that Truth. If the Oath be indeed unlawful, They are to blame who defend it: if lawful, They who oppugn it. If I be not an Heretick, he wrongs me who calls me ſo; nay, though I were, if he know not ſo much, he offends by laying to my charge what he cannot juſtifie; and I too for being guilty of what might be juſtifi'd, by one that did know it. He that has right on his ſide, is only blamleſs. And that in truth is the only Queſtion which is material. The reſt is inſignificant noiſe; All depends on, and ſtands or falls, with it. 'Tis neither the Oppugners I, nor the Defenders No, which will or ought carry it. Thoſe who can judge of what is alledged on both ſides, and will take the pains, will decide the difference. And with them I leave it, peradventure more a Difference, than Diſturbance, while things are managed as they may and ought. War is often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Peace, among Scholars as well as Soldiers. As long as we truly aim at Peace, and make fair Wars, Scholars poſſibly may as unblamably talk, talk, as Soldiers fight on both ſides. But there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unlawful Arms in both Wars; a tongue may carry poyſon as well as a bullet. Let the quarrel be never ſo good, this way of maintaing it is naught. If the Defenders be guilty of this kind of Diſturbance, I have nothing to ſay in their defence; only I hope the World will not think they are. Neither ſhall I charge the Oppugners: on the contrary I muſt acknowledge theſe Gentlemen are fair Enemies. Let him who is guilty on either ſide bear his own ſin, and till our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences can be ended, let both endeavor to mannage them without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.</p>
            <p>The 25. Conſideration tells us, the Pope ought not to refuſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an Action unlawful, when it is ſo, for fear of diſturbance. Which is to ſay, that the Pope makes the diſturbance, ſuch as is, but has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. Now, if he think it lies at the Popes dore, methinks he. ſhould not have laid it at the Defenders. Whether the Pope had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53776:66"/> or no, depends on what has been ſaid already; by which, I hope, appears, there is no Unlawfulneſs in the Oath, the declaring againſt which can be a viſible pretence for cauſing diſturbance in the Church. For the reſt, his Parallelling the Popes Breves, with the defining of Conſubſtantiality, and preaching of Chriſtian Doctrin, ſhew as if he thought the Oath contained ſomething like <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> or <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſm.</hi> Which if he do, he has reaſon to diſlike the Oath: but there was no reaſon to beat the buſh for <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> when there was more and better game afoot. If <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> be in the caſe, or as bad, I wiſh he would ſpeak out, that we may know, and avoid ſuch hideous things. But I love not to be a Chapman where there are but half lights.</p>
            <p>The 26th talks of an Intention to diſpenſe in ſome caſes, and not in others, in which though they would diſpenſe, they cannot. Which, he ſays, is the Caſe of Declarative Decrees. And this is very true, if the Declarations be according to Truth. But if they be not, I do not know there needs any Diſpenſation to ſtick to Truth. As for this matter of Intentions, this Gentleman and I, have, I perceive, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſomething different. As much as I thought neceſſary I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared upon occaſion. The reſt concerns not our buſineſs, and needs not be mentioned.</p>
            <p>The next Conſideration undertakes to ſhew, That <hi>what the Pope enjoyns in his Breves, cannot be prejudicial to the Duty and Loyalty due to Soveraign Princes.</hi> This is a Conſideration of importance, and therefore, as long as it is, deſerves to be fully weigh'd. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it puts the buſineſs upon this Iſſue, whether prejudicial, or not prejudicial, I conceive it agrees, that if the Breves be found prejudicial, we ought not to take notice of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is ſaid in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>He ſays then, That <hi>the Popes, though as jealous of their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as Kings, do not enjoyn us in theſe Breves to ſwear, that they have Authority to Depoſe Kings:</hi> nor forbid us <hi>to take other Oaths of Allegiance, as expreſſive as this, or more:</hi> nor <hi>to take the Clauſes of this Oath, which manifeſtly contain no more than meer Civil Allegiance:</hi> nor ſo much as to <hi>give an interior Aſſent to the Reaſons why they prohibit this Oath.</hi> I would gladly know what all this is to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and what it concerns us, who are inquiring whether what the Pope has don be projudicial to our Soveraign or no, to be amuſed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he has not don.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:53776:67"/>
            <p>It is plain, the Pope and King may fall out. It is plain, the Pope in ſuch a caſe may exerciſe a power which he thinks he has, and iſſue out a Sentence of Depoſition againſt the King; nay, 'tis undeniable He has don ſo more than once ſince the days of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible alſo He may recur to the <hi>Brachium ſaeculare</hi> for execution of that Sentence, and proſecute it both with foreign Arms, and as much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtin force as he can get to joyn with him. If any of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do joyn with him, (And they whoſe conſcience cheats them into a perſwaſion, that they ought in ſuch a caſe ſtand by the Pope, muſt fight either againſt their King or their Conſcience) I ſhould think they do the King ſome prejudice, unleſs it be none to be deſerted by his Subjects in time of need. And if the Breves do contribute to this, all the Pope has not don, will not hinder what he has don from being very prejudicial.</p>
            <p>Now the Breves which forbid the Oath of Allegiance, manifeſtly hinder the Kings Subjects from owning an obligation to ſtand by him in ſuch a caſe; and that is manifeſtly to leave them at liberty to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a perſwaſion, if they pleaſe, that it is their obligation to ſtand by the Pope. But in reality they do much more; <hi>Cauſe</hi> a perſwaſion in them, that they ought to ſide with the Pope againſt the King. For whatever fancies may work on men of ſpeculation, and how nicely ſoever they may diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>inward aſſent</hi> and <hi>outward compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> the plain-dealing World goes otherwiſe to work. Perſwade them once, it is not lawful to ſwear the Pope has not power to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and they will perſwade themſelves he has power to Depoſe. And when they have got this by the end, all the School ſubtilties in the World ſhall never make them believe otherwiſe, but that true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due to true power; and therefore if the Pope have depoſed, the King is not to be obeyd. They muſt needs then be perpetually ſollicited by their miſtaken conſcience, to withdraw their aſſiſtance from the King in ſuch a caſe, and perhaps carry it to his Enemies. And this Conſcience they owe to the Breves, and thoſe who bear them in hand they ought be obeyd. Now a body would think it is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to a Prince to have Principles foſterd in his Subjects, which diſpoſe them to refuſe their ſervice, when he has uſe of it, and take part againſt him, if they take any.</p>
            <p>Were there no more than bare ignorance of the inclinations of his Subjects, it would be prejudice ſufficient, and ſuch as would leave a King but few quiet hours. For with what ſatisfaction can He either
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53776:67"/> govern, or live, who knows not in whom he may confide, and of whom he ought beware? I do not ſee how this inconvenience can be avoided, if the Breves muſt be obeyd. For if no body muſt ſwear that the Pope cannot Depoſe, for ought he can know, every body may think he can. At leaſt, He cannot be ſecure of any one, that he ſhall be faithful when time is, becauſe, for any thing He can tell, That one may be perſwaded it is his duty to be otherwiſe. And ſo the King muſt of neceſſity live in a perpetual ſuſpicion and diffidence of every body. Which if this Gentleman think no prejudice to a King, I ſuſpect people will think him better vers'd in the Schools than World: If he do, he would have don well to have clear'd the Breves from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to theſe prejudices, and left the conſideration of what is not, till there be occaſion to ſpeak of it.</p>
            <p>This will not be ſhifted off by the Common Place of the ſecurity in which Catholick Princes live without ſuch Oaths of Allegiance. For to ſay nothing of the difference betwixt Princes of the ſame, and a different communion from the Pope; and again of the ſame, and a different communion with their Subjects; it is plainly one thing for people to have no Oaths offered, and another to refuſe them when they are. It is to be ſuppoſed thoſe Princes underſtand their own buſineſs; and if they judge ſuch Oaths needleſs, have reaſon to judge ſo. Whether they have or no, concerns not us. Our Princes are to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to underſtand their own buſineſs too, and ſince they have judged ſuch an Oath needful, it imports us nothing that others judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Talking in general is only to make a ſhew. Who has the Art of managing Common Places to advantage, may ſpeak plauſibly of any thing. Rhetorick teaches it every body. What is only material, is, whether theſe Inconveniencies do, or do not follow from an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey the Breves. For if they do, no example of foreign Princes can make that they do not.</p>
            <p>But to leave this, perhaps, impertinent digreſſion: The Pope, he ſays, <hi>does not enjoyn us in theſe Breves to ſwear that he has power to Depoſe Kings.</hi> What then, if he may enjoyn it in others? And why may He not as well and as rationally declare Depoſing power lawful, as not-Depoſing power unlawful (indeed one Declaration ſerves turn for both) and command us to ſwear the one, as forbid us to ſwear the other? Should the Pope do this, I would fain know whether he were to be obeyd or no? This Gentlemans Argument ſeems to bid fair for Obedience. For Popes are Superiors; Lawful and Unlawful are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53776:68"/> matters appertaining to them; and Superiors, he ſays, are to be obeyd in matters appertaining to them. The Command would be Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory too, and admit of no diſpenſation. But yet by his treating this Queſtion, I ſhould gueſs that once in his life he ſhould be for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as well as his neighbours. Becauſe to take advantage of what the Pope has not don, ſeems to allow, that it had been prejudicial if he had don it; otherwiſe it is no ſuch praiſe to forbear things unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial. And then by chuſing to inſiſt upon this point, that the Breves are not prejudicial, he ſeems to allow the Objection, which ſays, that prejudicial Breves are not to be obeyd. However, He may pleaſe to take his choice. If he ſay the Pope is to be obeyd in that caſe; to what purpoſe does he tell us the Pope has not don what he may do every day in the week if he pleaſe, and when he has don it, is to be obeyd? What is this either to the juſtification of the Breves, or our ſatisfaction? If he ſay the Pope is not to be obeyd, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World why we may not as juſtifiably diſobey a prejudicial prohibition, as a prejudicial command. For whatever this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would perſwade us, few, I believe, will think the prohibition in queſtion is not prejudicial, but thoſe who think the Pope has power to Depoſe. And then indeed he does no prejudice, or at leaſt wrong, to any body by preſerving his own Right. But That, I doubt, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rock in our way. Could we once weather it, all the reſt of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage would be ſafe enough.</p>
            <p>The truth is, we are either abſolutely obliged to obey the Pope in all things, and then prejudicial or not prejudicial are idle conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or we may juſtifiably diſobey him in ſome. If we may diſobey at all, we muſt begin ſomewhere. Where we ſhould begin, if we may not begin at the Breves, I cannot underſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For theſe, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells us, are prejudicial, beſides other things. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, I conceive, this Gentleman allows for a juſtifiable excuſe of diſobedience; becauſe I gather by his diſcourſe, he would take it for himſelf to diſobey the Pope, in caſe he ſhould command ſuch an Oath, which not to have commanded, is made his juſtification. For I cannot think he would obey in that caſe, though the Pope ſhould command never ſo poſitively, and deliberately, and declaratively, and excluſively of all theſe pretences which this Gentleman by and by calls frivolous. If he would obey, that action and this diſcourſe, in my opinion, would agree but ill. But if ſuch a conſcience would be an excuſe for him; we are abſolv'd from diſobedience, even in his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53776:68"/> own judgment, for we have that very conſcience.</p>
            <p>But after all, if we will not take National Coyn, but ſtand upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is current in the World, peradventure there is no ſuch great odds betwixt forbidding us to ſwear the Pope cannot Depoſe, and obliging us to ſwear he can. For why may I not ſwear he cannot Depoſe? Becauſe, ſays the Pope, 'tis contrary to Faith. Why then I muſt of neceſſity think either that the Pope is miſtaken, or that 'tis agreable to Faith, that he can depoſe. Who is truly perſwaded that depoſing Doctrin is agreable to Faith, I conceive, is fairly diſpos'd to ſwear it, if it be commanded by lawful Authority. And I ſhould think the difference betwixt actually ſwearing, and being diſpos'd to ſwear when required, not ſo extraordinarily material. Scruples indeed might be laid in the way, but I believe none ſuch which might not be eaſily enough removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I, But we are not obliged by the Breves to think that the Pope can Depoſe.</hi> Should this Gentleman tell the Pope ſo, perhaps he would have ſmall thanks for his pains, and poſſibly be thought no more obedient, than he thinks other folks. But what difference, as to what concerns the World, is there betwixt inward holding, and outward acting as if we did. The Conſcience may find a difference conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable enough, when the thoughts and actions agree not. But the World minds only what we do, and cares not a pin what we think, farther than as that thinking has influence upon our acting. Take now two men, whereof one thinks the Pope cannot Depoſe, and that there are not many things in the Oath contrary to Faith, and that the Pope was in the wrong when he made that Declaration; the other thinks quite contrary, that the Pope was every where in the right. If theſe two act alike, they are, in reference to the World, both in the ſame caſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, if he follow the dict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes of his conſcience, plainly muſt obey whatever the Pope commands in theſe matters; and the firſt muſt do the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if notwithſtanding the contrary dictates of his conſcience, he be obliged to obey too. And if he be obliged to obey theſe Breves, which his conſcience tells him are prejudicial to his Prince, and grounded on miſtake in the Pope, whatever prejudice and miſtake he may think in others, he muſt obey them for ought I perceive. For could his conſcience excuſe him then, it might do ſo now. If this be true, he ſeems obliged to every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot as much, as He who ſhould ſwear, that the Pope has power to Depoſe. For that Man by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53776:69"/> that Oath could only be obliged to obey the Pope in all he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning Depoſition; and this man, by this account, would be obliged to do juſt the ſame without taking that Oath. And then indeed that Oath may well be ſpared, ſince all that can be got by it, is had without it. But, I think, to mention that it was ſpared, might have been ſpared too; what the Pope has don by forbidding us to ſwear, amounting to little leſs, than what he has not don, commanding us to ſwear the contrary.</p>
            <p>He ſays farther, That <hi>I cannot lawfully take poſſeſſion of a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate, but may lawfully hinder my Adverſary from taking it.</hi> I muſt confeſs I wondred to ſee this from one who ſeems an Advocate for the Pope. For what? Will he ſay the Pope did unlawfully, when he took poſſeſſion of the Depoſing power? For he did ſo, as often as he exercis'd it, there being no more palpable, nor perhaps other, way of taking poſſeſſion of a power, than by uſing it. And that it is, and ever ſince its firſt origin has been a thing under debate, the Author of the former Treatiſe will inform him, though, I ſuppoſe, he needs no information in the caſe. This very prohibition enjoynd by the Breves, is a keeping poſſeſſion of depoſing power; To take it, the Pope thinks, is not now to do. For every body knows the Pope claims it, and every body thinks he has therefore forbid the Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhould not prejudice that claim. And to prevent being diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, is manifeſtly to keep poſſeſſion. But if it were unlawful to take it, I underſtand not how it is lawful to keep it, unleſs in circumſtances which can make a good Title of that which was originally bad, and which, I think, will not be pretended in this caſe. I cannot tell how well the Pope may reliſh this diſcourſe. We, for our parts, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to thank him for another juſtification of our obedience. For ſince the Command in other terms is, <hi>keep poſſeſſion for me,</hi> and this poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is acknowledged unlawful; to ſay we muſt obey, is to ſay, we lawfully may, and ought do an unlawful thing. And this puts another ſcruple into my head. If the Pope cannot lawfully take poſſeſſion of Depoſing, (ſince Depoſing is manifeſtly taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Depoſing) that two and three make five is not more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than that he cannot Depoſe. And then why may not this Gentleman ſwear the Pope cannot Depoſe, as well as his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? I mean, as they ſwear, according to the perſwaſion of his conſcience. For undoubtedly he is perſwaded that this which he ſays is true.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53776:69"/>
            <p>He tells us alſo, That the Breves <hi>forbid us not to take other Oaths of Allegiance wherein all civil Allegiance is contained in as, or more, expreſſive Terms, than in the preſent Oath.</hi> I conceive it no great wonder if theſe Breves do not forbid other Oaths, when there are no other Oaths to forbid. But I cannot eaſily perſwade my ſelf that any other Oath will be allow'd, whoſe Terms, to bate the <hi>more,</hi> are but <hi>as</hi> expreſſive as thoſe of this Oath. Who can bring me the hand of the <hi>Magiſter ſacri Palatij</hi> to an Oath, wherein ſhall be inſerted, That the Pope cannot by any means Depoſe the King, may convince me. But till then, he muſt pardon me if I be ſomething ſlow of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>He tells beſides, That <hi>we are not forbid to take theſe clauſes of this Oath, which do manifeſtly contain no more than meer Civil Allegiance.</hi> Peradventure who would preſs him to make this good, might put him to ſome trouble. For ſince the Prohibition is indefinite, it may as well be appli'd to every, as to any clauſe. But let this paſs. I only deſire to know, ſince the clauſes which contain civil Allegiance are ſafe, what clauſes there are in the Oath, which contain not-civil, that is ſpiritual Allegiance? I have not heard of any ſpiritual Allegiance claimed by it; and I ſee it declared by him, who beſt knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that he was even careful that nothing ſhould be contained<note place="margin">K. <hi>James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Preface to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology. Pag. 9.</note> in it, except the profeſſion of natural Allegiance, and civil, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral obedience, with a promiſe to reſiſt all contrary uncivil violence. And he charges them with impudence, and wilful malice, who affirm it was deviſed to intrap Papiſts in points of conſcience. Neither do I know that the Defenders of the Oath acknowledge any ſpirituality veſted in the King by this Oath. As far as I ſee, all this ado about Diſobedience to the Pope, devolves at laſt to this: We muſt take this Gentlemans word, or his who next finds fault, that this or that clauſe which diſpleaſes them, belongs to ſpirituals, and cannot be taken. For more than their words we have not, while the Breves remain in generals. And ſo if we ſay not as they do, This is Civil, This Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, we are diſobedient, or what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Since we can do no better, let us gueſs which clauſes he means by theſe which do not contain meer civil Allegiance. Till he aſſign them particularly, I conceive theſe ſeem as likely to be meant as any: <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Pope cannot Depoſe; I believe the Pope cannot abſolve me of this Oath.</hi> The Queſtion is, whether theſe contain more than civil Allegiance. I conceive they do not; becauſe all they ſay is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53776:70"/> but this: I believe the Bond of duty in which I ſtand bound to my Prince, cannot be cancel'd by Depoſition, or Abſolution. This duty, I conceive, is only what is due from a Subject, or from a member of a civil Society to the Head, and that, ſure, is Civil, and meerly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Allegiance. If there were any difficulty, the Oath it ſelf would reſolve it plain enough; which for all the Allegiance it requires, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only, not to ſtand againſt the King on Depoſing pretences, and to ſtand for him, notwithſtanding them. This Civil Allegiance if I preſerve, notwithſtanding the claim of a ſpiritual power, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not that I preſerve more than Civil Allegiance. And what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no more than preſervation of meer Civil Allegiance, contains no more than meer Civil Allegiance I think. It neither makes nor marrs, that the Power which would exempt me from this civil duty, is called, or is ſpiritual. For let it be what it will, that which I keep for the ſervice of my Prince, is not ſpiritual. I, and my Eſtate are temporal things, and remain temporal, let the power be never ſo ſpiritual which would diſpoſe of them. And ſince all I do by the Oath, is to preſerve theſe Temporal things, to be diſpos'd of by my Temporal Superiors, as the neceſſity of Temporal concerns requires they ſhould, All I do, and all the Oath expects I ſhould do, concerns pure Temporals, meer Civil Allegiance, and no more. Wherefore if what this Gentleman ſays be true, that we are not forbid to take thoſe clauſes of the Oath which manifeſtly contain no more than meer Civil Allegiance, there is no clauſe which we are forbid to take. For manifeſtly there is none which contains anything elſe. And ſo we may without ſcruple take the whole Oath, notwithſtanding the Breves, and have this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to abet us.</p>
            <p>I doubt all this will be thought ſuperfluous, and the Reader find but little ſatisfaction in detailing ware, which altogether is nothing worth, as I ſaid at firſt. The next thing he tells us is, That <hi>ſince we are not in rigor obliged to give an interior aſſent to the reaſons for which the Oath is forbid, who refuſes the Oath in compliance with the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, may think the Oath in it ſelf, and ſpeculatively ſpeaking, lawful.</hi> Say you ſo? Why then methinks in reverence to the Pope, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his proceedings, you ſhould produce ſome reaſon, why he ſhould make the Oath practically unlawful, which we may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all he has don, think is unlawful of it ſelf, and ſpeculatively. Beſides, Obedience to his Breves can no longer be preſt on the account of their Declarative vertue. For Thoſe, which make a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53776:70"/> are not Declarative. And then all depends on their Enactive vertue, to which this Gentleman, by flying to the Declarative, ſeems not willing to truſt. However, what he ſays, I conceive, is true; though, I doubt, neither of us will have any thanks from the Pope, for ſtanding upon rigorous terms with him. And, I conceive, that more is true, and that one may think the Oath practically lawful too. Yet if he who does not give an interior Aſſent, muſt act as he who does, 'tis no great matter what paſſes within them. In the mean time this is plain, that whoever refuſes the Oath, may think it not ſo much as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively lawful, and refuſe it for that reaſon, and not out of pure compliance with the Pope. And 'tis likely he does do ſo, becauſe that is indeed a good reaſon, whereas Compliment is not. For to compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment away our duty, is to compliment too far, even with a Pope. Wherefore as long as all muſt refuſe the Oath, I comprehend not what it will avail, towards cleering the Breves from prejudice, that ſome may think the reaſons of them not true. For all too may think them otherwiſe, and who does, and who does not, can never be known.</p>
            <p>Yes, ſays he. Theſe ſome <hi>who think the Acts contained in the Oath do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concern meer civil Allegiance, are bound, as long as they remain in ſuch a perſwaſion, to comply with thoſe Acts, whether they have taken this Oath or not.</hi> Truly theſe <hi>ſome</hi> are beholding to him, for juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the World, what they have always profeſt for themſelves, that it is their obligation to practiſe their Allegiance, whatever the Pope ſay or do to the contrary, and that they ought follow their own perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in theſe matters. I have only one requeſt to make in their behalfs, That, ſince They are obliged to all the Acts of Allegiance required by the Oath, notwithſtanding the Popes Breves, They may have his good leave to profeſs that obligation by taking the Oath, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Popes Breves. I cannot think the Pope would take it worſe of thoſe who ſhould act contrary to his expectation in the caſe of theſe Breves, than of thoſe who ſhould act contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in caſe of Depoſition; who yet, this Gentleman ſays, are obliged to act as they are perſwaded themſelves, which is plainly contrary to what the Pope is perſwaded: neither will he think a greater diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience committed by diſobeying his Breves, than by diſobeying ſuch Commands as he only made the Breves that he might, when he ſaw cauſe, give. And ſince this Gentleman ſays it is their obligation to act according to their own perſwaſions in that caſe, never ſo little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53776:71"/> indulgence for them ſhould, methinks, prevail with him to allow them to follow their perſwaſions about the Breves too.</p>
            <p>But how his diſcourſe will reliſh with his own party, I cannot tell. I doubt he is as bad an Advocate for them, as he was e'en now for the Pope. To ſay that thoſe are bound to comply with the Acts required by the Oath, who think they concern meer civil Allegiance, ſeems to ſay, that thoſe who do not think ſo, are not bound. Now the laſt thing he ſaid would perſwade us, that there are clauſes in the Oath which do not concern meer Civil Allegiance. Thoſe who think ſo, ſhould think, in conſequence of his diſcourſe, that they are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to comply with the Acts contained in thoſe clauſes. Thoſe Acts are, ſtanding by the King, in caſe of Depoſition, or Abſolution, which if only thoſe can comply with, who think they concern not Spirituals, for ought I ſee all muſt come over to the Defenders, who have a mind to paſs for good Subjects. For they will hardly do ſo, who will not comply with thoſe Acts, or think it not their duty ſo to do. I am aware of the diſtinction which may be caſt in my way, betwixt renouncing the power, and obedience to it. But I have ſpoken of that Argument already, and think it deſerves not to be brought into play again. The difference betwixt thoſe two is only in words. Who renounces one, in truth renounces both. Only who ſays, I will not renounce the power, but I will act as if I did, and never obey it; if he can ſatisfie his conſcience in making ſo bold with his obedienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, will hardly ſatisfie any rational man beſides, or make out how it can in reaſon be expected he will do as he ſays. For 'tis nonſence to ſay there may be power, and yet can be no obligation to obey it. Nor will he who acknowledges the power, and refuſes obedience to it, be thought an honeſt man, ſo much as by thoſe who think that Honeſty requires he ſhould renounce the power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> he tells us, <hi>the Popes do not forbid us in theſe Breves an Act of Loyalty or Civil Allegiance.</hi> This ſounds ſomething like, and, if it be well proved, may be to purpoſe. Profeſſion of Allegiance though ſhews, methinks, very like an Act of Allegiance, and 'tis plain the Breves do forbid that profeſſion of Allegiance; which the Law has appointed. Why do they not forbid an Act of Allegiance? Becauſe the <hi>taking of this Oath is not (properly ſpeaking) any Act of Civil Allegiance, but only a ſecurity thereof, and how little truſt is to be put in ſuch a ſecurity, does appear by the ſad experience of the late Wars.</hi> Sure he will not perſwade us that Oaths are matters of ſmall

There are who have don as much with their Bonds, and cheated their Creditors, notwithſtanding all the Caution they could uſe for their ſecurity. Muſt people therefore lend money barely on other folks words, and trouble themſelves no farther? This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, I ſuſpect, will reliſh but untowardly: For 'tis as much as to ſay, ſince you have been cheated by relying on Oaths, rely hereafter on leſs than Oaths, and take peoples words. For ſure enough they will ſtand to their words who break their Oaths.</p>
            <p>But why is not the taking of the Oath an Act of Allegiance? For this he gives us his word, that properly ſpeaking it is not. I am apt enough to believe he is well skilled in the propriety of ſpeech; but for all that, ſome reaſon why he ſays ſo, I conceive, would not have been amiſs. I think it is an uſual cuſtom for Vaſſals, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in what they hold of their ſupreme Lords to make a ceremonious profeſſion of Fealty, and that they are Liege men to that Lord. And I ſhould think an Act by which a man profeſſes himſelf a Liege man may properly enough be called an Act of Allegiance. It rather ſeems the moſt proper Act of all, as that on which all the reſt depend, and without which there could be no ſuch thing as an Act of Allegiance. For ſupplying a Prince with Money, or Arms, or whatever you will pitch on for an Act of Allegiance, is Aſſiſtance, not Allegiance, unleſs it be from a Liege man, and upon the ſcore of Fealty. And this being the Act by which he profeſſes himſelf a Liege man, and bound to do thoſe things which this Gentleman calls Acts of Allegiance, I ſee no ſhocking of propriety, if it be called an Act of Allegiance too. And ſo the Oath being a profeſſion of the Allegiance we ow our Soveraign, and our reſolution and obligation to perform it, may paſs for an Act of Allegiance if this Gentleman pleaſe, and no injury be don to ſpeech. However, as I love not to diſpute of words, if he will have it but an improper Act of Allegiance, I cannot but think it equivalent to the moſt proper Act that is. And ſuſpect a Prince, whoſe Subjects are hindred from profeſſing their Allegiance, will think himſelf as much prejudiced, as if they were hindred from performing that Act which can with moſt propriety claim the name. For indeed if they will not ſo much as profeſs they ow him any thing, with what ſecurity can he expect they will give any thing when time is?</p>
            <p>Yet ſuppoſe it were as this Gentleman would have it, not an <hi>Act,</hi> but only a <hi>Security.</hi> Is it no prejudice to a Prince to have that <hi>Security</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53776:76"/> taken away? How much leſs is he a Thief who tears the Bond, than he who ſteals the Money? Or if you will give him another name, you diminiſh nothing of his injuſtice. What this ſubtle diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> ſerves for, I cannot imagin while the injury, give it what name you will, is equal at leaſt, and if I miſtake not much, greater by making the Oath a <hi>Security</hi> than an <hi>Act.</hi> For who hinders an <hi>Act,</hi> deprives the Prince of no more than was to be had by that <hi>Act,</hi> ſo much money, or ſo much ſervice. But who takes away his <hi>Security,</hi> deprives him of all he can expect from all <hi>Acts.</hi> For nothing can be claimed but in vertue of Allegiance, and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to profeſs Allegiance, refuſes to be bound to any thing. So that the diſcourſe in ſhort is this: The Pope has don the King no prejudice, becauſe he hinders no <hi>Act</hi> of Allegiance in his Subjects, He only takes away more then an <hi>Act,</hi> only hinders him from being ſecure his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall ever act for him at all.</p>
            <p>But <hi>a Subject may be obliged,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to his Civil Allegiance, and equally puniſht for his not complying therewith, or for being a Traytor, whether he has taken the Oath or not.</hi> This is ſomething to thoſe who think the Oath contains nothing but Civil Allegiance; For They, by this account, are good Subjects, as being obliged to all which the wiſdom of the Nation thinks neceſſary to Civil Allegiance. And ſince taking the Oath is but openly profeſſing that obligation, which they otherwiſe have, I ſee not why they ſhould be obliged to make a ſecret of it. But what is it to the reſt, and what is it to the Breves? For that another may be obliged to that duty, which the Law and Prince call Civil Allegiance, is nothing to him who thinks it is not Civil Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, nor his duty. This ſeems little better than to delude his Prince with a Term: bear him in hand He ows and will pay Civil Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and when the Princes neceſſities, in caſe of Depoſition, call for ſuccor, tell him the caſe is not a caſe of Civil Allegiance, and he will do nothing for him. 'Tis true, he may, as this Gentleman ſays, and undoubtedly will be puniſht for a Traytor, if the Prince be ſtrong enough. But ſure no Traytor will be ſo haſtily mad, as not to ſtay till that danger be over, and till the Prince be no longer in a condition to treat him like a Traytor; and then what the Prince calls Treaſon he will maintain is not Treaſon, and have this to ſay for himſelf, that he never by Oath acknowledg'd That to be a Duty the failing in which the Prince calls Treaſon. Then for what concerns the Breves, are they no way prejudicial, becauſe ſome may be, as indeed all are, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53776:76"/> to their duty, notwithſtanding them, and becauſe they know they are ſo, think themſelves obliged alſo not to obey the Breves? Others may think themſelves not obliged, and may be induced by the Breves to think ſo. Theſe, if they act agreably to their thoughts, may act to the prejudice of their Princes Intereſt, and for this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, for any thing ſaid here, the Breves may be thanked.</p>
            <p>Yet from hence he concludes at laſt, <hi>it is manifeſt, That Compliance with the Breves cannot be inconſiſtent with the Duty and Loyalty due to Soveraign Princes, becauſe that reaches no farther than to all Acts of Allegiance, and the Breves forbid us no Act.</hi> This is to ſay, Allow me all I ask, and I will prove all I undertook. He had made uſe of his credit before, to recommend one Propoſition purely on his word: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>taking an Oath of Allegiance is no Act of Allegiance,</hi> and now recommends another upon die ſame ſcore, That <hi>Loyalty reaches no farther than to Acts.</hi> Truly I dare not entertain this ſo ſuddainly, for fear I ſhould be the only man of the World, beſides himſelf, of this opinion. Unleſs he would ſhew ſome reaſon to the contrary, people will hardly think that ſecurity of Allegiance is a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in which Loyalty is unconcern'd. To beg both the Premiſes is a little too much for one who pretends to prove, when any man may prove any thing who can have but one allow'd him. Beſides, why does he conclude with <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> when <hi>unprejudicial</hi> was what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove? Theſe two are ſufficiently different. For there is no inconſiſtence betwixt complying with the Breves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with Loyalty. He who obeys them may be dutiful enough, if he will always do what Loyalty requires. But becauſe a Prince can have no ſecurity that he will do ſo, he is prejudiced by the want of that ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I muſt needs think he has ſaid nothing, by which, what he would perſwade us follows, appears either manifeſt or true. What he ſays firſt, that the Pope has not don this or that, is as much as to ſay that who untiles the houſe, and leaves it open to the wind and rain, does no prejudice as long as be pulls it not quite down. What he urges next, that thoſe who think the Acts contain'd in the Oath do concern meer Civil Allegiance, are bound to comply with theſe Acts, as long as they think ſo, (to ſay nothing of the prejudice it is to a Prince to have his ſecurity depend on the good pleaſure, and changeable thoughts of his Subjects, as by his expreſſion it ſhould ſeem they are,) plainly ſuppoſes there are others who think otherwiſe, and ſo are not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53776:77"/> bound, and thoſe prejudicial thoughts, for any thing he ſays, are left to be imputed to the Breves. The Diſtinction he brings in the laſt place betwixt Security, and Act, though it were true, is ſo far from clearing the Breves, that it makes the prejudice greater. It being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs to have a part of my Eſtate taken away, than my Writings cancel'd, in which appears my Title to the whole. So that, I conceive, I may conclude a great deal more rationally, that becauſe compliance with the Breves is prejudicial to our Soveraign, we ought not comply with them, and conceive too, that he himſelf allows ſo much, by the method he has taken to anſwer the Objection.</p>
            <p>The 28 Conſideration is a pretty one. It happens ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween married people, that Jealouſie is pretended on that ſide, which gives the greateſt cauſe. This diſcourſe ſeems to have a tang of that Artifice. Of the two parties in the preſent debate, one is for the Pope, the other for the King, and he would perſwade us they are againſt the King, even by being for him. His Topick is, That <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions grounded on ſuch frivolous pretences, may be made uſe of as well againſt the King as the Pope, and ſo open a gap for Subjects to diſobey him, and render his Authority very weak and inſignificant, as in effect they do the Popes.</hi> Methinks it ſuits not well with the ſuddain zeal he pretends for the Authority of Kings, to ſay the Popes Authority is rendred inſignificant by Exceptions which endeavor to exempt us from obedience to him when he commands what is to the prejudice of Kings. But to let this paſs: It were, perhaps, enough to ſay in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him, that the Exceptions are not frivolous, and that his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are. For why ſhould not the No deſerve as much regard as the I? eſpecially when the exceptions are juſtifi'd by the conſent and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to uſe this Argument with more reſpect, I conceive, he ſtates the caſe wrong, and that his apprehenſion is wrong even of the wrong caſe he puts. For ſhould it be repreſented to a King, that there was not ſufficient conſideration of the Laws, in this or that command of his, or that He was miſinform'd concerning them, or miſtook them, I believe there are few Kings who would think ſuch a repreſentation frivolous, and who, if things be carried ſo as becomes Subjects to treat with their Prince, would not take it well, and be glad, if any ſlip of inadvertence happen to fall into the ground, to keep it from taking root, and growing. Nothing is more ordinary in diverſe Kingdoms, than to have the Kings grants, or commands pleaded on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53776:77"/> the one ſide, and the Law on the other. And when the Law carries it, as it often does, neither Judge nor Client is thought a jot the worſe Subject, though one have pleaded, and the other given it, againſt the King.</p>
            <p>But this in truth is not altogether the Caſe. He ſpeaks only of ſuch Commands of Kings as relate to matters wholy within their ſphere, whereas the Breves in queſtion relate to matters which concern not only the ſpiritual ſphere of the Pope, but the temporal too of the King. Now if any King command in a matter belonging to the Pope, I ſuppoſe he will ſay, that command is for that reaſon, not to be obeyd. If he demur to this, I would ask him why he refuſes the Oath of Allegiance? Is it not becauſe he thinks the Law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, exceeds its bounds, and requires more than belongs to the Civil Power to require? And ſo, becauſe he is perſwaded ſome parts of the Oath intrench upon Spirituals, and Spirituals appertain to the Pope, and the Pope has forbidden the Oath, he thinks himſelf obliged ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey the Pope than the King. By what he ſays in his Book, I take this to be his reaſon why he refuſes to obey the King in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Which if it be, 'tis plain he judges a command of the Kings is not to be obeyd, when it extends to matters without his ſphere, and is prejudicial to an Authority over which he has no power. If this be ſo, I ſee no reaſon why the caſe ſhould not be equal betwixt Popes and Kings, and that as Kings are not to be obeyd to the prejudice of Spirituals, ſo neither are Popes to be obeyd to the prejudice of Temporals. So that there is little ground to fear, that diſobedience to the Pope in matters which concern Kings, will introduce diſobedience to Kings in matters which do not concern the Pope. In ſuch things the Defenders prefer their conſcience before the Kings commands, as well as the Oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And there is leſs ground for him, who actually diſobeys the King, to aſperſe thoſe who obey him, becauſe they diſobey the Pope, when they have the very ſame reaſon not to obey the Pope, which He himſelf thinks a good and warrantable reaſon not to obey the King.</p>
            <p>When he ſays, <hi>the exceptions are to be decided by the Soveraigns themſelves,</hi> 'tis as he means by the word <hi>Soveraigns.</hi> For ſome, even Soveraign Princes, uſe the concurrence of their Subjects in the deciſion of ſuch things. But if he mean the Soveraign Temporal power, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exercis'd, undoubtedly there is no farther deciſion to be expected, and if there were, the power were not Soveraign. But then, to make
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53776:78"/> his Argument look any thing like, he muſt put ſuch a Soveraign powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the Pope in reſpect of the Church, as there is in the Soveraign Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power, in reſpect of the Common-wealth. And this, out of his own Territories, I ſuſpect will trouble this Gentleman to make good. For ſure the inferior Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy will expect ſome regard ſhould be had of them, and the Temporal Government will expect to be regarded in what concerns them. Wherefore though the Temporal Supremacy require, and when it is deni'd can force, an abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to what it determins within it ſelf, concerning it ſelf; the Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, as it is veſted in the Pope, ſeems not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo abſolute. Peradventure others may expect ſatisfaction in his deciſions, before they be fully obeyd, and 'tis plain he can force no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till all parties be agreed.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, if the exceptions be ſo frivolous as he pretends, be had the eaſier task of it to ſhew them ſo, and need not have given them cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by anſwers, at leaſt, as weak as they. In the Conſideration of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, there is not one word which leſſens, there is which heightens it. In that of Diſturbance, whereas the Objection was, that we ought not take notice of the Commands of the Pope, when the compliance with them may be a cauſe of great diſturbance in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers firſt; That the Defenders cauſe the diſturbance. As if it were any thing to purpoſe, while the Objection talks of diſturbance enſuing upon compliance, to talk of diſturbance which comes from not-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. Let the Defenders be as great diſturbers as they will, they are not to be charged with diſturbance in not complying with the Breves, if compliance be not due, which brings diſturbance, and this compliance will bring it. Theſe are the only Queſtions, and there is not one word ſaid to them. He anſwers ſecondly, That the Pope is not to forbear declaring what he ſees fit for fear of Diſturbance. And yet the Objection ſpeaks not of what he may, or may not do, but whether we ought to comply with what he does, in caſe of Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. Whether the Pope do well or ill is nothing to whether we are to obey him with diſturbance of the Church. Laſtly, he anſwers, that the Pope intends to oblige in ſome caſes, not in other. When we are not a jot concern'd in his intentions, while we are looking after our own duty, and whether that obliges us to comply with his intentions, when that compliance will cauſe diſturbance. So that there is not one word to the Queſtion in all his three Anſwers. I will recapitulate no farther, becauſe I have been too long already. 'Tis not good to ſpend
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53776:78"/> much time in frivolous things. But yet before people quit them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſuppoſe, they will be glad to know what they ſhall have more material in their room.</p>
            <p>The 29 Conſideration offers a new Objection, too long to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: and beſides, the great Lake is ſure to remain dry, if all the little ſtreams be ſtopt which feed it: and thoſe we ſhall meet with as they run. The firſt is the Queſtion of Sinfulneſs, which the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection imputes to Refuſal of the Oath. He undertakes to wipe off this imputation, and <hi>Num.</hi> 30. ſays firſt, That <hi>the Objection is againſt all or moſt of thoſe Catholicks who defend the Oath.</hi> I would intreat him not to trouble himſelf about them. Let them conform themſelves to Truth, if they will, where ever it be, and if they will not, at their own peril be it. Truth will be Truth, whether they like it or no, neither is it any matter for, or againſt whom the Objection is. Let us ſee what there is in the Thing: and for Perſons, let them take their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But yet why is it againſt them? Becauſe their <hi>Aim only is to ſhew, not that it is a ſin to refuſe this Oath, but that it is no ſin to take it.</hi> He has a mind, ſure, to compliment theſe Gentlemen, and let the World know they aim only at the juſtification of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and diſturb not other men in theirs. But what is this to the Queſtion in hand? Is a thing the leſs ſinful, becauſe others have no mind to ſay it is? Or does he who ſays it is no ſin to take the Oath, ſay therefore it is no ſin to refuſe it? I am of opinion, if they let this matter alone, it had been more to his purpoſe to have follow'd good example, and let it alone too. For what if the Devil prove ſurly, and will not be laid again, when he is once conjur'd up? Truly now he has put a ſcruple into our heads, unleſs he ſatisfie it well when he has don, He has furniſht us with the ſtrongeſt Motive that can be, not to refuſe the Oath. For I am very ſure he himſelf will juſtifie it to be our duty, not to do a ſinful thing for any bodys ſake. How then does he provide for the quiet of our Conſciences in this matter?</p>
            <p>In order to this he conſiders ſecondly, <hi>Whether the refuſal can be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unleſs the taking be obligatory.</hi> I conceive not. This being agreed, he denys, in his way of Queſtions, <hi>there is any obligation to take the Oath, ſince the taking thereof is no part of Civil Allegiance, as has been already ſhewn.</hi> All that has been already ſhewn is, that he aſſumed what he pleaſed without proof, and made the buſineſs worſe when he had don. The matter being diſcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſo lately, I have no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53776:79"/> more to do, but refer the Reader to the place as he does. I only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve he now calls a <hi>Part</hi> what before he called an <hi>Act</hi> of Allegiance, in which if he lay any ſtreſs, as I do not perceive he does, I think, the change of names alters nothing in the thing. He may well enough ſay that ſecurity that I will pay, is no part of the mony which I am to pay, as a Maſon is no part of the Houſe which he builds. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he is as neceſſary to it, as Mortar and Bricks, and ſo is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to Payment. I will dive no farther into a matter which has no intricacy, unleſs of our own making: conceiving it enough to ſay, That as plainly he is no honeſt man, who refuſes to give ſecurity for what he ows, ſo how he ſhould be a dutiful Subject, who refuſes to give ſecurity for his Allegiance, we ſcrupulous men, now he has made us ſo, cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>Next he tells us, <hi>his Majeſty does not abſolutely require of us the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Oath, but only conditionally, if we will enjoy ſuch and ſuch Employments or Priviledges which we are not bound to accept of.</hi> Till now I thought the <hi>Abſolute</hi> which he joyns to <hi>Obligation</hi> before, had been a word of redundance, for which reaſon I left it out as unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, when I quoted his words, conceiving that Obligation was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, what Epithite ſoever you joyn with it. But now, I perceive, he meant ſomething by it, which, I ſuppoſe, is, that ſome are, and ſome are not obliged to take the Oath. For when he ſays his Majeſty requires it conditionally, if we will enjoy ſuch and ſuch Priviledges, I conceive he means, his Majeſty does not require it of thoſe who pretend not to thoſe Priviledges, and does require it of thoſe who do. For if he require it of all, Priviledges have nothing to do with the caſe. And ſo conditional obligation, ſignifies not-obligation. Thoſe who will have their Priviledges being abſolutely obliged, and thoſe who will bate them not at all. This truly is to purpoſe. For if none be obliged to take the Oath but thoſe who will enjoy Priviledges, Thoſe who will be content to paſs without them, are free. Wherefore 'tis but diſſwading people from being concern'd in Priviledges, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is don.</p>
            <p>But what are theſe Priviledges, in which we need not be concern'd? who refuſes the Oath of Allegiance incurs a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies loſs of Eſtate and Liberty. Call you theſe Employments and Priviledges, ſuch of which we are not bound to accept? Is no man bound to accept of his Liberty, or not turn Beggar? Priviledges, I thought had ſignified extraordinary Rights granted by favor to ſome
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53776:79"/> above others. Theſe are common to all; Nature teaches us to love, and our Need to ſeek them; and 'tis the end of Civil Society to preſerve them. They are the things which make a life not only ſweet, but uſeful. For who languiſhes out his days in Priſon, and has nothing to maintain him there wants, the means of doing good to himſelf and his Neighbor, which if he had, might be very beneficial to both. I ſay no more of this point, becauſe I think it needleſs to tell people that which Nature tells them a great deal more ſtrongly, that they ought be concern'd in theſe Priviledges, if you will call them ſo. The hard task is that which belongs to this Gentleman to perſwade them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and in which he had need employ more Rhetorick, than to tell us driely we are not bound to accept of them, if he expect to prevail much. Mean time, ſince there is as much obligation to take the Oath, as to preſerve Goods and Liberty (For thoſe who will enjoy them, I conceive, 'tis granted are obliged) All are obliged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado to take it, but thoſe whom he can perſwade they are unconcerning things, and that they have no account to make God for caſting away ſuch uſeful means of working out their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Though it be plain enough that none are exempted by this diſcourſe, from obligation to take the Oath; yet to put the matter out of diſpute, I muſt inform this Gentleman, if he know it not already, that there is an Act of Parliament purpoſely made to extend the obligation to all the Kings Subjects. He will find it 7 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 6. though with ſome difference of perſons. Thoſe of employments are directed where and when to take it, the reſt let alone till they are call'd upon; which if they never be, he may well enough ſay, they are free till then. For the Law obliges them not to go and take it without ſummons. But there is no Subject who may not be call'd upon, and when he is, and refuſes the Oath in open Seſſions, incurrs not <hi>Praemunire.</hi> And if requiring it of all, under ſuch a penalty, do not put an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on all, I know not how Subjects can be obliged by Law.</p>
            <p>He ſays farther, That <hi>though thoſe who refuſe the Oath in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, are liable to ſome penalties enacted againſt Roman Catholicks, yet they are puniſht even in that caſe, not ſo much for refuſing the Oath, but becauſe by refuſing it they are ſuſpected to be Popiſhly inclined.</hi> What this means I can hardly tell, unleſs, perhaps, that who is puniſht for refuſing the Oath, ſuffers for Religion. This I muſt in plain terms
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53776:80"/> ſay, is a ſcandal to Religion, and which, after ſo plain declarations as have been made to the contrary, cannot be ſaid with any reaſon. Though it were as he ſays, that the Refuſers are puniſht for inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Popery (which in one ſence is true, the Oath having been framed to diſcover thoſe who are ſo) it would not therefore follow there is any leſs obligation to take the Oath. For taking <hi>Popery</hi> as Proteſtants themſelves take it, for an <hi>Undue adhaeſion to the Pope in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations touching the true way to ſuppreſs Popery.</note> 
               <hi>Principles or Practiſes falſly pretended to be Chriſtian,</hi> he muſt ſhew why this ſhould not be puniſhable, even in Catholick Countrys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can pretend we cannot be obliged to renounce it in ours. But I rather gueſs than know his meaning, being hardly able to make any thing of what he ſays. <hi>The Refuſers,</hi> he ſays, <hi>are liable in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;</hi> as if there were any in which they were not liable, or as if circumſtances made or marr'd. Then, <hi>Liable to ſome Penalties enacted againſt Roman Catholicks,</hi> as if theſe Penalties were enacted againſt Roman Catholicks for being Roman Catholicks, and not-Roman Catholicks were not as liable to them, as they, if they refuſe as well as they. Again, <hi>Liable</hi> (for refuſal, I ſuppoſe) and yet <hi>not puniſht for refuſal, ſo much as for other ſuſpicions.</hi> As if they were not puniſht for that reaſon for which they are liable; or as if the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments appointed for Refuſal, would or could be inflicted but for refuſal; unleſs, perhaps, the ſame puniſhments be appointed for other faults, which is not our caſe. Let there be, or not be other reaſons why refuſers are puniſht, ſure they are puniſht for refuſing the Oath, when by taking it they may ſcape thoſe puniſhments. But indeed the whole to me is riddle. Circumſtances, and Reaſons, and what elſe he adds, make a noiſe, which a body would think had ſomething in it. But that ſomething is a ſecret into which I cannot dive. Yet he would have it follow, that <hi>no abſolute obligation of taking the Oath can be proved:</hi> as if the Laws enjoyning, and Magiſtrates requiring, did not put an abſolute obligation upon the Subjects to thoſe Laws and Magiſtrates. And actual loſs of Goods and Liberty were not a proof, that they oblige thoſe, from whom they take them, to do that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing which they take them.</p>
            <p>The 31 Conſideration tells us, <hi>It cannot prudently be preſumed, that the forbearance of the Oath is manifeſtly ſinful.</hi> Methinks the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Queſtions as theſe ſhould not depend on Preſumptions. Many things happen to be true, which often cannot be very prudently preſumed. As time was when he would hardly have been thought well
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53776:80"/> in his wits, who ſhould have preſumed there had been convenient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under the Line, or that people walk feet to feet to us. And yet both are now manifeſtly true. 'Tis to ſpoil time and Paper to ſtick upon ſuch collateral Topicks, which may be multiply'd World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end on any thing, and ſerve nothing to the clearing of Truth. But yet what are theſe preſumptions. <hi>Grave, and Learned, and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Men</hi> (I forbear to ſpeak of the Pope, having ſaid ſo much of what concerns him already) <hi>maintain the forbearance of the Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Intereſt, and divers have ſuffered Impriſonment or Death.</hi> To their <hi>Gravity,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> I have nothing to ſay; only I think it no miracle to ſee a grave and conſcientious Man ignorant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. As for their <hi>Learning,</hi> it matters not what it is in other things, if it fail them here: and that it does not, now he is on the proving hand, he ſhould do ſomething more than preſume. <hi>Intereſt</hi> is an harſh ſtring which I will not touch, but I think he knows there are who dare preſume to think, that every body who ſpeaks againſt the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, does not act againſt his Intereſt. As for the <hi>Authority</hi> of thoſe who have ſuffered for refuſing the Oath, it will ſignifie ſomething when he produces reaſons ſufficient to juſtifie their ſo doing. For, <hi>Sect.</hi> 96. He tells us that no account is to be made of Authors, whoſe grounds are falſe, or inconcluſive. If the Refuſers of the Oath had no good reaſons for their refuſal, they are to be pityed, but not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: If they had, it would do well to bring them forth, that we may have wherewith to juſtifie our ſelves in following their example: otherwiſe it is no vertue to imitate the defects even of good Men. Neither ſhall we have that to ſay for our ſelves which they had. For they had reaſons, ſuch as they were; which unleſs they appear to us, they may have done very well, and yet we ſhall do very ill in doing the ſame action without reaſon.</p>
            <p>It is no great wonder that people were impriſoned for refuſing the Oath, it being the penalty appointed by Law. As for Death, it is an unjuſt aſperſion to mention it, and an injury to the mercy of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which none ever died purely for that matter. We ſee divers are perſwaded the Oath is unlawful, and if they act as they think, the marvel is not great. The wonder is that it ſhould be expected, that others, who are not ſo perſwaded, ſhould ſuffer for company. Among Sheep if one leap into the ditch, the reſt will follow; but to ſay that <hi>Men muſt</hi> do ſo, is to make Men no better than Sheep. This is the fineſt way of doing the buſineſs that ever was thought of. Prevail
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53776:81"/> but with ſome to ſuffer, by Sophiſm, or how you will, and then 'tis no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> matter whether it were Sophiſm or no; the reſt need not hear of it, but muſt ſuffer, becauſe the firſt have ſuffered, and ſo all are in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble of giving a reaſon why. In ſhort, their ſuffering is an Argument they were good Men; and not moved by any intereſt of the World, ſince they voluntarily quitted the more conſiderable of Temporal Goods. But it is no Argument of the goodneſs of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or truth of what they ſuffered for; while the worſt of Hereticks, and perhaps Atheiſts too, can name their ſufferers. As good Men of all other, are the moſt apt to be impos'd upon: they may thank ſuch Arguments as theſe for what they have ſuffered. If others have no mind to be beholding to them for ſuch obligations, I think they may be pardoned. Sure I am, it is a very prepoſterous imitation of their example, and juſtifiable neither to God nor Man; if what they did according to the dictates of their Conſciences, we do contrary to the dictates of ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Num.</hi> 32. The conſideration of Schiſm comes into play; which I for my part, unleſs the word be taken improperly, conceive imputable to neither party. For it ſignifies a breach of Unity in the Church: and where both ſides are united, both to the Head, and among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I ſee no Schiſm. If either proceed ſo far, as to refuſe communion to the other, let them anſwer for the Schiſm when it happens. For the preſent, thoſe ſeem nearer the brink, who object Hereſie to their fellows: becauſe they object what, if it were made good, were a juſt cauſe of breach of Communion. But ſince they are not ſo ſevere in their actions as words: and communicate freely with thoſe who, if they were ſuch as they ſay, were not to be communicated withal: there is no more Schiſm between us, than betwixt Jeſuits, and Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, Thomiſts, and Scotiſts, and the reſt. Though if there were, what he has ſaid makes nothing to the juſtification of his party. For ſince both acknowledge the Head, the Schiſm muſt of neceſſity be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Members. Now all he tells us is, that their ſide joyns with the Head, as if the other did not do ſo too: and as if it were any thing to purpoſe, to ſay they are not Schiſmaticks in reſpect of the Head, when the queſtion is of Schiſm between the Members. Wherefore, though in my opinion his diſcourſe is none of the beſt, yet while it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not our queſtion, I think I may let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Num.</hi> 33. He tells us, <hi>Union among Catholicks in</hi> England <hi>in order to this point, may be had two ways; if All take, or All refuſe the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53776:81"/> Oath.</hi> Union indeed in this point were to be deſired; yet there is no fear of Schiſm, if we remain diſunited in our judgments, while the unity of the Church is preſerved. But this Union, I fear, is more to be wiſht than hoped. People have been divided about this Queſtion, ever ſince it was firſt ſtarted: and I ſee no great likelihood it will be otherwiſe yet a while. Quiet we may be, if we pleaſe, if every one be content to follow his own conſcience, and leave his Neighbour the liberty he takes himſelf. And he whoſe Zeal will needs fly out, is to anſwer for his tranſport, and the harm which comes of it. But united in this point, I doubt, we ſhall not be ſo ſoon, unleſs he would give us better reaſons than he does, why All ſhould refuſe the Oath. <hi>It is more eaſie,</hi> he ſays, <hi>and more warrantable that the minor part ſhould conform to the major, than the major to the minor.</hi> As if number ſignifi'd any thing. It is not eaſie for him who has Truth on his ſide, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that Truth for any conſideration, but by being perſwaded that it is not Truth, nor warrantable if he do. Nor do I think he will find it ſo eaſie a matter to perſwade the Takers they are not warranted by Truth. Again, he ſays, <hi>'Tis more rational for the Members to ſubmit to the Head, than the Head to the Members.</hi> This indeed is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be ſuppoſed. But yet it may happen, that the Head may ſlip into what is not rational ſometimes. And then it is more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for him to conform himſelf, not to the Members, but to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than for the Members to conform themſelves to what is not rational. Who has, and who has not Reaſon on his ſide, is the only point worth conſideration: all elſe is but to talk plauſibly from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The next two Paragraphs are employ'd in Reaſons why Catholicks ſhould rather refuſe than take the Oath. And they are all ſuch as ſhould neither be mentioned, nor ſo much as thought of. An honeſt man has no more to take care of, than to perform his duty, when 'tis required, and leave the ſucceſs to Providence. Selling of duty, and bargaining before hand what I ſhall get by it, as if the joy which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the diſcharge of a good conſcience, were not reward enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this World, and God would forget us in the next, ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct not very creditable to Religion. Beſides, indeed they belong more properly to thoſe to whom it belongs to offer the Oath, than thoſe to whom it is offered; and to their conſideration I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave them.</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot take leave of theſe Paragraphs, without wondring a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53776:82"/> the confidence with which he ſo poſitively affirms, that the far greater part of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks have hitherto been for refuſing the Oath. He ſays indeed at laſt, that 'tis a confeſt point, which if it be true, for I know not what adverſaries he means, I think they with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and he too are both out. Of the perſwaſion of the preſent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have a little experience in what hapned among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Lords. When the Oath was preſt upon them, my intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence fails me, if the refuſers were the far greater part. I am told they were the leſs. And I think there is reaſon to gueſs it would be among the Commons, as it was with them. For the influence of thoſe of his Principles is thought to be as great on the Nobility as others.</p>
            <p>For the ancient Catholicks we have the teſtimony of <hi>Withrington,</hi> one of them, and who knew what paſt. He in his Preface to his <hi>Diſputatio Theologica</hi> tells the Pope, that very few (<hi>pauciſſimi</hi>) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay-Catholicks of any note refus'd the Oath: and in his <hi>Purgation,</hi> that the Oath was daily taken by almoſt all Catholicks of the better ſort, to whom it was tendred even by thoſe who had Jeſuites for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors. Poſſibly this Gentleman may not think very well of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrington;</hi> but ſure he does not think ſo ill, as that he would tell the Pope a lye to his face, in a matter of fact which every body could ſee were a lye, when he had ſo many Adverſaries ready to catch at every advantage he gave. Or if he would lye to the Pope, I am ſure it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any prudence be preſumed he would lye to an Adverſary, who knew how things went as well as himſelf, and appeal to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the matter. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had ſaid the Oath was refuſed by Catholicks. <hi>Withrington</hi> in his laſt Rejoynder, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. replies, He could not be ignorant that where one Catholick hath refus'd it, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred have taken it. And this was written in the year 1633, almoſt thirty years after the framing of the Oath, when in all likelihood it had been taken or refuſed by all the Catholicks in <hi>England.</hi> So that, by this Gentlemans favor, the Ancient Catholicks were of another mind than he fancies them. Nor can I think but he reckons without his Hoſt, when he counts the Refuſers far more numerous at preſent. We have little more, perhaps not ſo much, ſaid to us as they had, and 'tis ſtrange we ſhould receive for current, what they thought adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate.</p>
            <p>And ſo we are come to the head of ſcandal, in anſwer to that part of the Objection, which ſaid, that <hi>to refuſe the Oath is ſcandalous to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53776:82"/> Religion, as if the Principles thereof were inconſiſtent with Civil Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance due to Princes.</hi> I cannot imagin how this Objection can be anſwered otherwiſe, than by denying the Principles in queſtion belong to our Religion; or are inconſiſtent with Allegiance, though they do; or are ſcandalous to Religion, though they be both inconſiſtent with Allegiance, and belong to Religion. This laſt way, I ſuppoſe, will be trod by few. For to ſay Religion teaches Principles inconſiſtent with Allegiance, is palpably to hinder people from embracing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that is palpable ſcandal. Wherefore all depends on the other two, whereof I, for my part, ſhould chuſe the firſt; and fear who does not, is no friend to Religion, otherwiſe than in wiſhes. Yet if it could be made out that thoſe Principles do conſiſt with Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Religion would be ſaved harmleſs. But this, I doubt, will never be done. However, let us hear what this Gentleman ſays to the point.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>Num.</hi> 36. That the ſcandal, if any be, is rather <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum</hi> than <hi>Datum,</hi> becauſe Catholicks have been Loyal in the late Wars. I ſuppoſe he would have it thought by this, that the Principles in queſtion have no inconſiſtency with Civil Allegiance; but I do not think he could have choſen a Topick leſs to purpoſe. For what had thoſe Principles, and that Loyalty to do one with another? no body ever ſaid or thought, but a man of theſe Principles might be loyal enough, in occaſions where they have no influence. The Queſtion is, whether they do not hinder a man from obeying a King depoſed by the Pope, and whom the Pope commands not to be obey'd, and whether that hindrance be conſiſtent with Allegiance, or no. What is it to this Queſtion, to talk of what Catholicks have done, when there was no depoſition, and where the Pope never medled? The Loyalty of thoſe <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who ſtood by the King againſt the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> and his Excommunications, has indeed ſome relation to the matter; and did he approve the Principles by which they acted, he had ſomething to ſay. And then, I ſuppoſe, he would not write againſt the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. But the Civil Wars of <hi>England</hi> have no more to do with the caſe, than the Wars of <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Conſideration tells us, Proteſtants would think ne'er a whit the better of us, though we ſhould all take the Oath, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the worſe. Till he have Commiſſion to ſpeak for Proteſtants, I ſuppoſe, they will deſire to ſpeak for themſelves, and conceive we ought not take their Sentiments barely on his word. But what matter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53776:83"/> is it what Proteſtants think, or not think? what they have reaſon to think, is all that concerns us. There are among Proteſtants, as in all mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, Reaſonable, and Unreaſonable. And becauſe they will think, and ſpeak, and act differently, I preſume the Reaſonable will not take it well, if the ſentiments of the reſt paſs for the ſentiments of all. As the letter he mentions, till it be own'd by more than a ſingle man, is, I think, unreaſonably made the ſence of Proteſtants. But let them think as they pleaſe. We, for our parts, are to look to our own duty, not other mens thoughts. When we have complied with that, we have no more to do. What others will think of it, is a matter out of our reach, for which God is to provide, and will; and to him they are to give account who think amiſs of us for well doing. We are to ſatisfie thoſe whom Reaſon will ſatisfie: for the reſt, at their own peril be it.</p>
            <p>Our Queſtion is of ſcandal; that ſcandal with which the Church may be aſperſed if ſhe teach Principles inconſiſtent with Allegiance; and which, I conceive, conſiſts in this, that thoſe who are not of her Communion will hardly be perſwaded to embrace it, and thoſe who are, eaſily be wrought upon to deſert it, if that aſperſion cannot be wiped off. It would be ſhewn why both have not reaſon, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more manifeſt than that the Church whoſe Principles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Allegiance, is not the true Church. To this he ſhould have ſpoken, if he would have ſpoken to purpoſe. Nothing can be wider of the mark, than to tell us there will be unreaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions made of our actions; As if there were not unreaſonable people every where, and thoſe who are ſo would not act unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The taking of the Oath,</hi> he ſays, <hi>would be ineffectual to the End pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi> This End, I conceive, is to free our Religion from the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Principles inconſiſtent with Allegiance. The Catholick now who takes the Oath, teſtifies his Religion is not guilty of ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, while he complies with his Allegiance, and ſtill keeps his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Why is not this effectual to that End? Becauſe <hi>Proteſtants would not therefore have a better opinion of our Religion, but worſe opinion of Catholicks who take the Oath, as profeſſing a Religion, to whoſe Principles, as by Proteſtants underſtood, they are aſhamed to conform.</hi> If this were ſo, the ſcandal would be removed from Religion to the perſons who profeſs it. For this imputation falls only on them. And if Proteſtants continue ſtill to think amiſs of Religion, thoſe are to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53776:83"/> be thanked, who have given them occaſion to think, that they ſwerve from the Principles of it, who profeſs their Allegiance. Their fault it is if taking the Oath be not effectual to the end pretended; and they ſhould do well to conſider what account they will make to God for the ſcandal.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould it be thought that Proteſtants would have theſe opinions? I conceive he wrongs them with an unreaſonable ſuſpicion. They would plainly have reaſon to think, that thoſe who they ſee ſtick to their Religion, after they have owned their Allegiance, are not aſhamed of their Religion, or any Principles of it. Unleſs they believed all thoſe Fools or Knaves who take the Oath, they would have reaſon too to judge, that their Religion has no Principles incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Allegiance. For they were Knaves who ſhould profeſs Allegiance contrary to the Principles of their Religion, and Fools who did not know what their Religion teaches. And ſince there is Reaſon for Proteſtants to entertain other opinions than thoſe he fancies, he may think of them as he pleaſes; I, for my part, cannot think but reaſon would ſway with them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, what means, <hi>as by Proteſtants underſtood?</hi> This, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Proteſtants underſtand the Principles of our Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not with Allegiance, to which Principles thoſe are aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, who are not aſhamed to conform to their Allegiance. When Proteſtants underſtand things in this manner, I would intreat this Gentleman to tell us what he thinks of the matter, whether they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand things right, or no? If they do, and the Principles of our Religion have indeed an inconſiſtence with Allegiance, Proteſtants plainly do well to underſtand things as they are, and he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think himſelf of a reaſon to give them, why they ſhould not think ill of a Religion of ſuch Principles. If they underſtand wrong, and our Principles be truly conſiſtent, he ſhould do well to ſpeak out, that we may underſtand one another, and in ſted of hiding our Queſtion in the Proteſtants thoughts, tell us how it happens that they are in the wrong. Whether becauſe thoſe Principles are not Principles of Religion, or conſiſt with Allegiance though they be. One would gueſs he has a good mind to the latter, and would have it at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But the difficulty lying in this, Whether it be agreable to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to fight againſt the King, or at beſt not fight for him when the Pope depoſes him, and puts a neceſſity of diſobeying either the Pope for the Kings ſake, or the King for the Popes, and what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53776:84"/> the refuſing Principles would have in that caſe, and only that caſe: there is not one word to the point in all his diſcourſe, that I perceive, not ſo much as <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what he urges, <hi>Sect. 38. That we ſhall be accounted not Loyal for refuſing the Oath of Supremacy.</hi> I know not what reaſon he has to fear ſuch hard meaſure from Proteſtants. I do not hear they do, what he ſays they will do, and believe I can produce Proteſtants who allow ſome Catholicks loyal, though they know all refuſe the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. When the time comes, we ſhall ſee what is to be ſaid to them. I ſuppoſe if he had as much to ſay for refuſal of the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as of Supremacy, he would make better work of it. Yet he proves this conceit of his, becauſe <hi>Proteſtants acknowledge the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Spirituals is inherent in the Crown, and conſequently that to refuſe the Oath of Supremacy is to refuſe the Supremacy of his Majeſty in Temporals.</hi> What Proteſtants acknowledge, themſelves declare. He may diſpute that point with them if he pleaſes. But I do not think they acknowledge this conſequence of his, who denys Supremacy in Spirituals (meaning as the word ſignifies, purely Spirituals) denys it in Temporals. They have no reaſon to thank him, in my opinion, for making them no better Logicians. If that be all they have to ſay for fixing diſloyalty on the Refuſers of the Oath of Supremacy, I believe we may reſt ſecure. For they are too reaſonable to ſay it. His proof of this, as indeed it needs proving, is, That <hi>who refuſes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any thing inherent to the Crown, refuſes, at leaſt implicitely, to acknowledge the Crown and his Loyalty.</hi> Which is but to ſay the ſame more in general, leaving out the words which diſcover the fallacy. Otherwiſe, by <hi>any thing</hi> is meant <hi>any ſpiritual thing,</hi> and by Crown is meant <hi>power in Temporals.</hi> And ſo 'tis juſt the ſame again; who denys Spirituals, denys Temporals.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs farther, I cannot but obſerve, That what he ſays here, is an Argument that Proteſtants are not likely to judge ſo croſly as he imagins. For if they cared for no more than a pretence to aſperſe Catholicks with diſloyalty, right or wrong, what needed they have made the Oath of Allegiance, when, according to him, the Oath of Supremacy would have ſerved their turn as well? no Catholick could ſcape the imputation, if Refuſal of the Oath of Supremacy would fix it on them; this way All may. If any be in love with an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo laudable, and will by no means part with it, the fault ſure is not in the Proteſtants. It would, in my opinion, become our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53776:84"/> to judge more rationally, and our Charity more favourably of our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The laſt conſideration, <hi>Sect. 39. That the Takers would create ſcandal in the Refuſers, ſeeing how they ſlight the expreſs order of the Pope;</hi> would make a Man ſuſpect he has forgotten what he is talking of. He is anſwering this Objection; that inconſiſtence of its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with Allegiance, is a ſcandal to Religion: And he talks of a ſcandal, not to Religion, but to particulars; and not for inconſiſtence of principles, but ſlighting of commands. Let the Takers be as ſcandalous as you will, and for what reaſons you will, ſtill the ſcandal remains upon Religion; unleſs its principles be cleared from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with Allegiance. To do this, I thought had been his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to fall upon other things ſeems a ſtrange way of doing it, and which argues, he gives it for deſperate, and finds nothing will be done in it.</p>
            <p>As for the difficulty it ſelf, it is the boyl'd Capon we have had all this while, of which I now grow weary. Who juſtly gives, who blameably takes the ſcandal he talks of, depends on what has been diſcourſt all along, who has right on his ſide. If any harm come by the ungrounded perſwaſions of weak people, I think they owe it to thoſe to whom they owe thoſe perſwaſions; and have nothing to ſay to thoſe, who do what they can to ground them better. Sure I am there is no ſcandal in ſaying, our obedience to the Pope, or any body, ought not to carry us to any thing ſcandalous to Religion. There is no ſcandal in ſaying, there is nothing ſaid by this Gentleman, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from Religion the ſcandal objected to it. For to talk of the Loyalty of Catholicks, and thoughts of Proteſtants, (all the Meat he gives us with variety of Cookery) is to feed us with ſteam, inſtead of ſubſtance. There is no ſcandal in ſaying, he can ſee into the Milſtone as far as another. Which if he do, and no body can clear the Objection better than he; the refuſal is plainly ſcandalous for the reaſon objected. And becauſe, if the Refuſal be, the Taking cannot be ſcandalous; who fright weak Conſciences into ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, have ſomething, I doubt, to anſwer for their own.</p>
            <p>The Objection urged further: <hi>That ſhould the Pope declare it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to bear His Majeſty civil Allegiance (which is due unto him by the Law of God and Nature) we ſhould not think our ſelves bound to ſubmit to ſuch a Declaration.</hi> This I conceive he grants, <hi>Sect.</hi> 40. and then I ſee not why the diſpute is not at an end. For the caſe of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53776:85"/> the Breves is the very caſe propoſed. The Pope has declared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contained in the Oath of Allegiance is ſinful. Beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declarations of thoſe who beſt knew what is in the Oath; it is manifeſt to eye-ſight, that nothing is contained there, but profeſſion of civil Allegiance, due to His Majeſty by the Law of God and Nature; and renouncing a power to take that civil Allegiance away. 'Tis manifeſt, that if there were any ſuch Power, it might work, and take away that civil Allegiance, and deprive the King of what is due to him by the Law of God and Nature. <hi>But to deny unto him civil Allegiance, due by the Law of God and Nature,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is manifeſtly ſinful;</hi> and then how can what he ſays next, that <hi>in matters manifeſtly ſinful, we are not bound to obey the Ordinances of our Superiours, whether Spiritual or Temporal,</hi> be hindred from being applyed to the Breves; and concluding that they are not to be obey'd. For they do deny him civil Allegiance in caſe of depoſition, and declare 'tis ſinful to hold it due; at leaſt as far as can be gueſt at the meaning of the indeterminate declaration, and as it is actually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by thoſe who are againſt the Oath, and every body elſe. There is no means of eſcaping, that I can imagine; but by ſaying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ither that civil Allegiance, is not civil Allegiance; or, that civil Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance is not taken away; when the duty of ſerving the King with our Fortunes and Perſons is taken away: or, that ſuch ſervice is not due, when the Pope forbids it. The two firſt are manifeſt Nonſence; the laſt is the very caſe of the Objection, in which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Pope's declarations are not to be obey'd. Wherefore I ſhould think there is an end of the ſtory; and the tedious troubleſome queſtion, which has vext us ſo many years, fully reſolved.</p>
            <p>Yet, I ſuſpect he has reſerv'd ſome Fence for this Flail in this bold manner of expreſſing himſelf, That <hi>ſuppoſing (as he does ſuppoſe) His Majeſty is our Soveraign in civil concerns, and that not only in order to the civil Power, but alſo to the exerciſe thereof; Then to deny,</hi> &amp;c. What this means, I cannot tell. But I think the King is not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Man's ſuppoſitions for his Soveraignty; and ſuſpect 'tis plain Treaſon, to ſuppoſe otherwiſe. Again, what means <hi>Soveraign, not only in order to Power, but to the exerciſe too?</hi> Can one of theſe be ſuppoſed without the other; or can it be imagined, without Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Pope or any body can hinder the exerciſe of the King's Soveraignty in civil concerns? Till he explain himſelf better, and let
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53776:85"/> us know what he means by them, and for what uſe he lays them up, I can ſay nothing to them, and ſhould not be forward to meddle with ſuch tender matters, though I could. What I ſaid before, I think, is clear: That the King, independently of ſuppoſitions, is, by the Law of God and Nature, Soveraign in Civil concerns, both in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>power,</hi> and the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it: That the obedience due to this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power in Civil concerns, is Civil Allegiance: That the Breves hinder the profeſſion of this obedience, and the exerciſe of it in caſe of Depoſition. And becauſe 'tis acknowledged, that to deny Civil Allegiance is manifeſtly ſinful, and that Obedience is not due to the Pope in matters manifeſtly ſinful, the buſineſs, I think, is concluded, and All may take the Oath of Allegiance even with this Gentlemans good leave.</p>
            <p>The 41 Paragraph ſays, <hi>'Tis not reaſonable, becauſe we may diſobey in matters manifeſtly ſinful, to diſobey in matters manifeſtly or probably lawful. And the forbearance of the Oath is confeſt to be ſo by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</hi> What they confeſs I cannot readily tell, nor am curious to examin, as caring more to know what is, than what is ſaid. But, I conceive, 'tis not manifeſtly or probably lawful to forbear Allegiance, or the profeſſion of it when lawfully required. And ſince I cannot ſee any thing elſe in the Oath, I cannot ſee how to forbear it, when law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully required, ſhould be manifeſtly or probably lawful. Unleſs in vertue of extrinſical probability, from the number of thoſe who ſay the contrary, whom to take for guides, except they have reaſon for what they ſay, is to be guided without reaſon. In the following <hi>Section</hi> we have a new account of what the Pope has not don; which if he thought worth repeating again, methinks he ſhould have choſen a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place. For it ſuits but ill with our conſideration, what would be, if the Pope ſhould do as is objected, to tell us he has not don it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken ſo lately of this matter, I ſee no reaſon to ſtop at it again. Only, I humbly intreat him in behalf of the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> to forbear ſuch kind of Topicks. For they ſeem to inſinuate as if their Allegiance depended on the Popes carriage to the King. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n which I know not how he could do them a greater, or more irrational injury. And ſo his performance upon this branch amounts to this; To grant the ſubſtance, and by that grant reſolve the Queſtion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Adverſaries, and ſay over again a thing he had ſaid a little before, nothing at all to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Objection proceeds to urge, <hi>That the Oath contains only a meer
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53776:86"/> Civil Allegiance, as our Kings have declared, and to them it belongs to declare what is meer Civil Allegiance, and not to the Pope, whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extends only to Spirituals.</hi> To this he ſays, <hi>Sect.</hi> 43. That <hi>whatſoever a Prince is pleaſed to put into an Oath, which he terms an Oath of Allegiance, is not to be held as appertaining to meer Civil Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</hi> Undoubtedly; if he put in any thing which does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to Civil Allegiance. But the buſineſs is, ſince he has declared he has don no ſuch thing here, why we may not believe him, but muſt believe he declared he knew not what. Though he had made no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration at all, it is clear enough of it ſelf, that ſtanding by the King with our Lives and Fortunes, even againſt the Pope as well as another, if they happen to fall out, and the Pope attempt on his Civil concerns, is meer Civil Allegiance. Pray why may we not believe the King ſaid true, that he required meer Civil Allegiance, when we ſee there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this in the Oath?</p>
            <p>He goes on to tell us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 44. That <hi>becauſe an Oath, ſtiled an Oath of Allegiance, may contain things not appertaining to Civil Allegiance, the Pope may judge of ſuch an Oath.</hi> Yes, if it do contain ſuch things. But barely that it may, is no argument that it does. I would fain know by what Chymiſtry this potential <hi>may</hi> will be turned at leaſt to actual <hi>is. If ſo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſince this preſent Oath contains ſuch things, as has been declared above, the Pope may judge of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Oath.</hi> I thank him kindly. This <hi>ſince it contains</hi> is the thing to be proved. If he had a mind to aſſume the point in queſtion, he might have don it at firſt, as well as laſt, and made no ſuch ado with his may-be's. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he ſuppoſes this has been declared above. Thither by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample I refer my ſelf, where the Reader will find why I am not of his opinion, and judge as he ſees cauſe between us. Laſtly, he would have us <hi>ſtand to the Popes judgment in order to ſuch things, rather than the Kings Declaration.</hi> As if all Catholicks did not do ſo in order to ſuch things. But that theſe are ſuch things, there this Gentleman leaves us.</p>
            <p>Methinks a plain matter needed not be rendred obſcure by learned handling. All that is in the caſe is, Whether the Oath contain Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals only, or Spirituals alſo? The Pope has declared the one, the King the other. As for what concerns Juriſdiction, I think both may judge of the caſe, which in that reſpect ſeems equal betwixt them; one judging independently in Temporals, and the other in Spirituals. Now our concern is to know, which of the two judges right? For who goes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53776:86"/> with the ſide which judges wrong, as one of neceſſity muſt do, muſt needs go wrong. The Objection is for the Kings judgment, this Gentleman for the Popes. His reaſon is, becauſe there are Spirituals in the Oath, which is the thing in queſtion. The Objection aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gns no other reaſon but the Kings juriſdiction, and in that point, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the caſe equal. But there is this reaſon, that the King who made the Oath, muſt needs know better than the Pope what is meant. We, who muſt reſolve one way or other, can have no other guide but the judgment of Authority, or our own. 'Tis not eaſie to be guided by Authority, where the two Supreme Authorites are directly contrary. But if we will put nothing elſe into the Scales, there is the better knowledge of the matter of fact to weigh on the Kings ſide, which is not on the Popes. Neither do I think it would have been allow'd in Catholick times, to ſubmit the interpretation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws to foreign Tribunals. The Statutes of <hi>Praemunire</hi> and <hi>Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> were heretofore judged to contain Spiritual matters, and long and ſtrongly oppoſed by the Pope; but yet remained notwithſtanding; our Catholick Anceſtors preferring their own judgment before hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>But I doubt, whatever learned men ſay, people will do at laſt what their own judgments tell them is to be. At leaſt did they not carry a great ſtroke in the buſineſs, this Gentleman and I ſpend our time, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, but idly in informing their judgments.</p>
            <p>The Objection goes on, and ſo do his Conſiderations; but to what parts of it they are deſign'd for anſwers, I am often at a loſs. So that I can only obſerve what he ſays, without knowing whether he ſpeak to the point. What the 45th Conſideration ſays, is true, but what he will make of it, he neither ſays, nor can I imagin. The 46th tells us, becauſe the King is to be obey'd only in Civil matters, and the Pope only in Spiritual, thoſe of his way think themſelves not bound to ſubmit to the Kings Orders, ſince the Oath contains things not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Civil Juriſdiction. And this laſt, he ſays, has been proved, and, I think, his proof has been diſproved, and there it reſts. This, it ſeems, was intended for anſwer to an Argument made by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in behalf of the King, parallel to his own. In which he denys the Major, that the matter appertains to the King, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mentioned. Whether it do or no, has, I conceive, already been ſufficiently debated, and I love not repetitions. Civil Allegiance, I think, and ſecurity for meer Civil Allegiance, are matters very much appertaing to Kings. I am ſure I ſee nothing elſe in the Oath, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53776:87"/> till this Gentleman ſhew me the Spiritual thing, which is there beſides, cannot believe there is any ſuch. And therefore, I for my part think my ſelf obliged to obey the King.</p>
            <p>The next Conſideration, <hi>Sect.</hi> 47. attempts to prove, that we ought in this caſe, ſubmit rather to the Pope's commands than the Kings. His firſt reaſon is; becauſe, though both be Supream, yet in their ſeveral kinds, <hi>the Pope's Supremacy is of a higher Hierarchy, than the King's Supremacy. And certainly, when two Supream Governours claſh, we are bound, caeteris paribus, to ſubmit to him whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is of a higher Hierarchy, than to the other.</hi> This would have ſhew'd ſomething more excuſable, if he had kept it confin'd to this caſe. But when he gives a reaſon which extends to all caſes, and by adding the Univerſal propoſition, argues in this manner; we muſt obey here, becauſe we muſt obey every where; he ſays, what I hear with extreme grief from a Catholick, and which I think becomes not the mouth of any good Subject. No King I believe will take him for ſuch, who is diſpos'd, in all conteſts with the Pope, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit rather to the Pope's orders than His: And our King, for the difference of Communion, has more reaſon to be jealous than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I beſeech him to keep this Doctrine for himſelf, and thoſe whom he can perſwade into it; In behalf of the reſt, I heartily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt it. Yet Proteſtants, he ſays, will not deny it. I have already obſerved; that, in my opinion, he undertakes for Proteſtants farther than he has commiſſion. But whatever they do, I am ſure there are Catholicks who think it very falſe, and very pernicious beſides.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider too in our turns. <hi>The Pope in this caſe is to be obey'd, not the King.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe his Supremacy is of a higher Hierarchy.</hi> What then? what neceſſity is there of obeying the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Hierarchy? <hi>Becauſe certainly we are bound, caeteris paribus, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, whoſe Juriſdiction is of a higher Hierarchy.</hi> That is, we muſt obey the Pope, becauſe certainly we muſt obey the Pope. For <hi>higheſt Hierarch</hi> is <hi>Pope</hi> in other words, and unleſs it be ſhown how the notion of ſupreme Governour in holy things, (for that the word imports) make his commands carry it, againſt the commands of the ſupreme Governour in Temporals; He might have kept his uſual name, and that notion never have been troubled. Beſides, if the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy be of a higher Hierarchy, the King's, unleſs the compariſon be Nonſence, is of a lower Hierarchy. And <hi>Hierarchy</hi> ſignifying
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53776:87"/> government in ſacred things; the King by this account is a Governour in ſacred things, which who would have expected from this Gentleman?</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon is, <hi>becauſe according to the common ſentiment of Divines and Canoniſts, when it is doubtful whether ſuch a matter conſidered in it ſelf does appertain to the Spiritual or Temporal Court, it belongs to the Spiritual Judge to decide to which of theſe two Courts it does appertain.</hi> I beſeech you, what reaſon have theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Canoniſts for this common ſentiment of theirs? Becauſe, ſays he, <hi>other circumſtances being equal, the Spiritual Judge is to be preferred before the Temporal.</hi> This is the <hi>higher Hierarchy</hi> again. It belongs to the Spiritual Judge, becauſe it belongs to the Spiritual Judge. Thoſe Divines and Canoniſts who argue in this manner, will run a hazard of being thought themſelves as common as their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I but, <hi>there is no other commodious way to decide the Queſtion.</hi> Pray why is it not altogether as commodious, if the Temporal Judge decide it. To travel a thouſand miles for a deciſion which may be had at home, methinks is no ſuch commodious thing.</p>
            <p>Since he would needs meddle with this nice queſtion of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Courts, I think it would have been well if he had advis'd with ſome beſides his Divines and Canoniſts, before he had advanced their Doctrine in <hi>England.</hi> I am informed the Law of <hi>England</hi> is, that, in caſe of queſtion, the Temporal Court is to judge whether the matter belong to the Eccleſiaſtical or not. And that this Law was made and practis'd by our Catholick Anceſtors. If this be ſo, he ſhould not expect the higher Hierarchy of his Divines and Canoniſts ſhould carry it with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks, againſt <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Laws. Whether it be or no, he may inform himſelf at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For I think he will not take my word; nor will I paſs it in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein I have no skill.</p>
            <p>But yet I can ſee that, if his Doctrine muſt every where paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled, Temporal Judges will quickly be very uſeleſs things in the World. For ſince, vertuous or vicious, is a conſideration appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all even poſſible caſes, and the determination of that matter belongs to the Spiritual Judge, there is no caſe whereof he may not claim the cognizance. And if the Temporal Judge muſt always ſubmit, within a while there will be nothing left for him to do. And yet I think, the World would not find it very commodious, to have Temporal Judges taken quite away. Again, if the matter be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53776:88"/> examined, I doubt, it will be found, that Spiritual Courts were ſet up by Temporal Authority. To <hi>Preach,</hi> to <hi>Bind</hi> and <hi>Looſe,</hi> and what elſe was given by Chriſt, is indeed derived from a higher origin; but to <hi>hold Pleas,</hi> and act in the nature of Judges in Courts, I ſuſpect proceeded from the piety of Princes. Which, if it be true, it ſeems more commodious, and more proper, that the Temporal Power ſhould judge, whether a matter in debate be of the number of theſe which are by that Temporal Power committed to the Spiritual. He who gives, I think, can beſt tell what he gives, and what he meant to give.</p>
            <p>The 3d Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the Pope requires leſs of us than the King.</hi> Suppoſe he do. Why ought we obey him who requires leſs? Becauſe, <hi>when two Precepts contradict one another, we ought to ſubmit to that Precept of the two</hi> caeteris partibus, <hi>wherein leaſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> required of us.</hi> Very good, We ought, becauſe we ought. Theſe reaſons, I ſee, are all of a piece; but, methinks, it had been more for the credit of his Divines and Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>iſts to have let them alone, than brought them upon the ſtage with ſuch reaſons in their mouths. But yet how much leſs do's the Pope require of us than the King? Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>the Pope only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we ſhould not take this Oath: the King that we ſhould poſitively take it as it lies; which is far more.</hi> Truly he is in the right there. Speaking is doing ſomething, and keeping ſilence is doing nothing, and <hi>Something</hi> is plainly more than <hi>Nothing.</hi> But this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Metaphyſically; for if we conſider the matter morally, the Popes <hi>Nothing</hi> may, perhaps, amount to more than the Kings <hi>Something.</hi> Since refuſal of the Oath is <hi>Prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to require us to refuſe it, is to require all our Goods, and our Liberty beſides; and this, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever notions they have in the Schools, is a very conſiderable <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> in the World. The King now requires neither, but only ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when he needs them, of aſſiſtance both in our Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Service, according to the proportion alotted by Law, and which we are bound to afford him, whether he take ſecurity or no. Now I ſhould think ſecurity, and only for a part, and only when the time comes, and for that to which we are bound however, is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much as the whole it ſelf, all at a clap. But the truth is, I fear, all this is but time loſt. <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>not Duty, True</hi> or <hi>Falſe, Sin</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> and the like conſiderations are worth examining; what <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Leſs</hi> have here to do, none but his Divines and Canoniſts, I think, can tell.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53776:88"/>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the Popes Precept in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is negative, but the Kings affirmative.</hi> And why muſt we obey the Negative, and not the Affirmative? Becauſe <hi>when two Precepts op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one another, we ought rather, all other circumſtances being equal, to embrace the Negative Precept than the Affirmative, according to the common opinion of Divines.</hi> And this again is, we ought becauſe we ought. And this is all we have from firſt to laſt, and which, I think, needed not have been brancht out into ſo many particulars. For though we had never heard of the higher and lower Hierarchy, the Spiritual and Temporal Court, the More and the Leſs, the Affirmative and the Negative, we could well enough have underſtood in two words, <hi>We muſt becauſe we muſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What follows <hi>Sect.</hi> 48. has partly been toucht before in behalf of the Pope; here 'tis preſt againſt the King. <hi>Since</hi> Withrington <hi>and the reſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>confeſs that</hi> whether the Pope has Authority to depoſe Kings <hi>is yet under debate between Popes and Kings,</hi> Certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Scholaſtici, &amp; adhuc ſub Judice lis eſt, <hi>Why ſhould the King decide the Queſtion in his own favor?</hi> Sure <hi>Withrington</hi> and the reſt, how little ſoever they underſtood the Queſtion, underſtood <hi>Latin</hi> better than to render <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtici certant</hi> there is a debate <hi>between Popes and Kings.</hi> Which ſide, of the queſtion propoſed, is true or falſe, is debated among School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alone; that point was never debated between Popes and Kings. Each were reſolved of the truth of their own ſide beyond debate, and thought it, not to be diſputed, but defended. You may call their Conteſts, Debates, if you pleaſe; but then the word has quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence, than when you apply it to School-men. For there it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies inquiry after Truth, here a defence, of what they are ſatisfi'd is Truth, by force. I am much miſtaken if the King can be named, who thought there was any doubt to be made whether his Subjects were not to aſſiſt him, when he had uſe of their ſervice, even againſt the Pope, and whatever the Pope would do to the contrary. Not but that diverſe have ſuffered School-men to diſpute this matter without check; For which, I ſuppoſe, they had their reaſons. But when the occaſion came, they expected the ſervice of their Subjects, and they had it, even they in whoſe Territories there was moſt freedom for theſe diſputes. Pray what harm is there, if our King decide the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in his favor by words, which all Kings decide in their favors by Arms?</p>
            <p>Becauſe this <hi>is, as it were, to take poſſeſſion of the part favorable
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53776:89"/> unto him; and as long as it is under debate, neither can take poſſeſſion till the Queſtion be lawfully decided in his favor.</hi> I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that this peremptorily decides the Queſtion in favor of Kings. For to Depoſe being manifeſtly to take poſſeſſion of depoſing, the Pope, by this account, cannot Depoſe; and then the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can or no, is plainly at an end. But why cannot Kings decide Queſtions even in their favor, and take poſſeſſion of what they judge belongs to them, while there are debates among School-men? I do not think they ow ſo much deference to the Schools, and ſuſpect the World would go on but odly, if Kings were obliged to expect till Scholars be agreed, which will be never, before they proceed to what they find convenient for the good of the Common-wealth. I had thought it belongs properly to Kings to decide ſuch Queſtions. Scholars may diſpute, and decide as they pleaſe; no body needs take notice of their diſputes or deciſions, farther than as their reaſons convince. To what Kings decide, all, even Scholars themſelves are bound to ſubmit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they underſtand ſuch things better than all the Scholars in the World. The Authority to decide what is, or is not requiſite for the ſafety of the Common-wealth, reſts only in them; nor can there be any other, from which the lawful deciſion he ſpeaks of, can be expected, if theirs be ſupreme. If another ſupreme Authority acquieſce not in their deciſion, it is like to be tryed out by the <hi>Ratio ultima Regum,</hi> if both perſiſt reſolute. But their Subjects ought acquieſce in their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and for themſelves, ſince their Authority is ſupreme, they have no body of whom to ask leave to make them.</p>
            <p>And for taking poſſeſſion, that follows Deciſion of courſe; though in truth, Kings do not take, but keep poſſeſſion. They were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Allegiance of their Subjects before School-men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Popes were in the World. Popes would put them out of this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in certain caſes, and ſome School-men ſay they may. Cannot Kings keep their own, becauſe others pretend a title? Were it this Gentlemans caſe, and that the Pope ſhould claim the land he holds by inheritance from his Anceſtors, quietly enjoy'd by them time out of mind, I hardly believe he would part with it, for all the debates of all the School-men in Chriſtendom. And yet the King, ſure, has a ſtronger title to his Kingdom, than he, or any private man to his Eſtate. In ſhort, that Kings cannot decide while School-men debate, nor take poſſeſſion of what they, who are the ſupreme Judges of their own rights, judge to be their right, becauſe thoſe who have nothing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53776:89"/> to do with judging, make a moot caſe of it; nor keep poſſeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is called taking poſſeſſion; ſeem to me very unreaſonable aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for which if any reaſon can be brought, this Gentleman at this time has forgot to bring it.</p>
            <p>The 49 Conſideration talks off the Popes <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> Power, and ſays it is inconſiſtent with the Soveraignty of the King in Temporals. And 'tis very true, that 'tis indeed very inconſiſtent. But what he deſigns by avowing truth, I cannot gueſs. I hope he does not mean to obtrude upon us the <hi>Indirect</hi> Power in its ſted, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us the Kings Soveraignty in Temporals is ſecured by ſhifting of names. For the <hi>Indirect</hi> Power is altogether as inconſiſtent as the other; and ſhould the Pope declare himſelf Soveraign in Temporals, over any part of his Majeſties Dominions, with an <hi>Indirect,</hi> or <hi>occaſional</hi> Power, or what name ſoever you would give it, he would declare a thing as deſtructive to the Kings Soveraignty in Temporals, as if he declared what this Gentleman ſays is manifeſtly deſtructive. But 'tis not for me to inlarge on this point, while he leaves it only to be gueſt, whether he meant it or no.</p>
            <p>Yet, I think, I may gather out of his Diſcourſe, that ſince the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> Power cannot therefore belong to the Pope, or Spiritual Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe it is inconſiſtent with, and deſtructive of Temporal Soveraignty; no Power which is inconſiſtent, and deſtructive can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Pope, or Spiritual Juriſdiction. Wherefore, unleſs the Power of Depoſing, which the Pope claims, call it by what name you will, be conſiſtent and not deſtructive, neither can it belong to the Pope, or Spiritual Juriſdiction. Now who will undertake to ſhew, that the Depoſing Power is not inconſiſtent, nor deſtructive, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes a difficult, and, I think, impoſſible task. For to Depoſe a King, is plainly to take away his Authority in Temporals: and when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Temporals is taken away, 'tis plain there remains no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Temporals. Now, if the Negative deſtroy the Poſitive, not-Authority, I think, muſt needs deſtroy Authority: and unleſs contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories can ſtand together, to have, and not to have Authority muſt needs be inconſiſtent. 'Tis not a Term which can ſhift off this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Call the Depoſing Power <hi>Indirect,</hi> or <hi>Caſual,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or what you will, if it be a Power to Depoſe, 'tis a Power to take away Authority in Temporals, and Power to take away Authority in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals is irreconcilable with Authority in Temporals, and much more with <hi>Supreme</hi> Authority in Temporals. Neither is there any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53776:90"/> which he has brought againſt the Oath of Allegiance, which may not be applied to an Oath renouncing the <hi>Direct</hi> Power; in caſe the Pope ſhould forbid it, in the ſame terms in which he has forbid the Oath of Allegiance. For there would be taking poſſeſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding the Queſtion, while the matter were in debate; there would be diſobedience to the Supreme Paſtor, in matters appertaining to him, at leaſt which he declares appertain to him; and we are to ſtand to his judgment, whether they do or no, and ſo of all the reſt. But if we be not bound to ſtand to his judgment in that caſe, neither are we in this, and for the very ſame reaſons; becauſe this Power which he does claim by this declaration, is as inconſiſtent with, and as deſtructive of Temporal Soveraignty, as the <hi>Direct</hi> Power. Wherefore I cannot ſee but the diſpute is at an end again, and all Depoſing Power confuted by this Gentlemans diſcourſe as fully as may be.</p>
            <p>Again, when he ſays, <hi>It belongs to a Soveraign Temporal Prince to determin what is preciſely neceſſary for the conſervation of his Temporal Soveraignty in caſe he be unjuſtly attackt by another in his Temporals:</hi> This too ſeems to determin the Queſtion. For the King does judge, that to renounce the Depoſing Power is preciſely neceſſary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Temporals; nor can he be ſaid unjuſtly to attacque the Pope in Spirituals by conſerving his Temporals, but is himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly attacqued in his Temporals, if he be hindred from conſerving his Temporals. Wherefore he does no more than 'tis confeſt belongs to him. But when the Pope declares him no longer Soveraign in Temporals, I doubt he exceeds the bounds preſcribed him even by this Gentleman. For he ſays, <hi>It does not belong to the Pope, or Spiritual Court, to declare who is Temporal Soveraign of ſuch a Kingdom,</hi> which, I think, is to ſay, that it does not belong to them neither to declare who is not Temporal Soveraign of ſuch a Kingdom, which is the very thing call'd Depoſing.</p>
            <p>The 50th Conſideration, to ſhew how willing <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks are to give any juſt ſecurity of their Loyalty, propoſes another form of Oath, rather more expreſſive, as he thinks, of Civil Allegiance than the Oath in force. And I make no queſtion but he truly thinks as he ſays, and, as good meaning is All in All, conceive his Expreſſions, as he means them, may do well enough. But yet, I doubt, he has no more commiſſion from Catholicks to offer ſuch a form of Oath, than he had from Proteſtants to undertake for their ſence of things. I ſhould think it more becomes Subjects humbly to acquieſce, where
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53776:90"/> with a ſafe conſcience they can, in what lawful Authority thinks fit to require, than by their propoſals direct that Authority what they ſhould require, unleſs they be called to counſel. Yet had he ſpoken only for himſelf, I ſhould not have medled in his buſineſs, but left it entirely to the conſideration of thoſe to whom it belongs to judge of it. But ſince he talks as if what he ſaid were the ſence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks, I muſt needs ſay, that he has done them no good office in giving occaſion to have it thought ſo. For his form is liable to ſo many exceptions, ſuch as I for my part cannot anſwer, that I fear, inſted of appearing the loyal Subjects he would have them, they may chance, by ſticking to it, be aſperſed with ſuſpicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of ſeeking to delude their King and fellow Subjects. I thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me to prevent that miſchief, and ſhew why I conceive Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks neither do, nor rationally can inſiſt upon his Form; though if he can get it approved by thoſe to whom it belongs, I ſhould, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all would readily ſubmit to their Wiſdom and Authority.</p>
            <p>His firſt clauſe is for ſubſtance the ſame with the firſt clauſe of the Oath of Allegiance, though the expreſſions are not altogether free from exception. For <hi>Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53776:91"/> that what he, who is the only proper Judge, Judges repugnant to his power, ſhall not be judged not-repugnant. And beſides, becauſe one may pretend of any thing, that it is not repugnant, till it be judged re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, nothing at all is renounced till Judgement be paſt. And when will that be?</p>
            <p>The next Clauſe is, That <hi>they confeſs themſelves obliged in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be as obedient to his Majeſty in Civil Affairs, as true Allegiance can oblige any Subject to be to his Prince.</hi> And here again we are left in generals, and left in doubt what this true Allegiance means, and to what it obliges. Who ſhould think that Allegiance to a Depoſed King is not true Allegiance, becauſe he is no true King; or that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to which they were obliged, were taken away by Depoſition, and their obligation with it; or that true Allegiance does not oblige any Subjects to obey a Depoſed Prince; would not break his Oath, though he ſhould not only diſobey, but fight againſt his King, when the Pope had Depos'd him. So that it may very well happen that this true Allegiance, as handſomly as it ſounds, may yet ſignifie no Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at all.</p>
            <p>There follows a promiſe, <hi>to bear inviolably, during life, True Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to his Majeſty, His lawful Heirs and Succeſſors, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them againſt all attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made againſt their Rights, the Rights of their Perſons, Crown, or Dignity, by any perſon whatſoever, or under whatſoever pretence.</hi> This ſeems to bid fair, and yet the manifeſt change of the Expreſſions uſed by the Oath of Allegiance, is apt to alarm ſuſpicious people. For why ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt the Kings Perſon, Crown, or Dignity, as it runs in the Oath, be changed into attempts againſt their Rights, and the Rights of their Perſons, Crown, or Dignity? By this alteration we are left to diſpute whether an attempt againſt the King, be an attempt of his Right; and who thinks he has no right, after the Pope has Depos'd him, plainly promiſes nothing, but remains at liberty even to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt him. There are, if I miſtake not, who maintain that a King Depos'd by the Pope is no longer King <hi>de Jure,</hi> but only <hi>de Facto;</hi> an Opinion which is thought, and is indeed, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Authority of Kings. This Form affords it ſo much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (though, perhaps, but caſually) that I cannot think he has befriended Catholicks in uſing their name to an offer ſo little becoming them.</p>
            <p>In the next place they promiſe to <hi>uſe their beſt endeavors to diſcover
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53776:91"/> to his Majeſty or Miniſters all treacherous Conſpiracies.</hi> And this is well, provided that by <hi>Treacherous</hi> he meant what the Law means. For if any ſhould think theſe Conſpiracies not treacherous, which are made by Authority of the Pope againſt a Depos'd King, he might be an arrant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Traytor without breach of his Oath. Laſtly, They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Doctrin which maintains, That <hi>any private Subject may lawfully kill the anointed of God, his Prince,</hi> a Clauſe which, as bad words as it gives that Doctrin, is not very ſatisfactory. For a private Subject may be ſaid changed into a publick Miniſter, if he act by Authority. And then, to kill the <hi>Man,</hi> may be ſaid, is not to kill the <hi>Prince,</hi> if he ceaſe to be ſo by depoſition. To theſe, and, perhaps, as many more Exceptions, the ſeveral Branches are liable.</p>
            <p>But now to look upon it in groſs, nothing could be more improper for what he deſigns by it; which is to ſhew that Catholicks are Loyal, and ready to give ſecurity of their Loyalty. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks were never ſuſpected of Diſloyalty by any body, but only in one caſe, when their credulity might be deluded by pretence of Religion; an abuſe to which all Nations and all Times are ſubject as well as they. The pouder Treaſon, to uſe almoſt the words of King <hi>James,</hi> plotted by Papiſts, out of a prepoſterous Zeal for the advancement of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and which had blinded ſome of them to that degree, that even at their death they refuſed to acknowledge and ask pardon for their fault, gave occaſion to the Parliament to uſe all means of Tryal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any more of that mind were yet left. They deviſed the Oath of Allegiance to make a diſtinction between Papiſts of quiet diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in all other things good Subjects, and ſuch other Papiſts as in their hearts maintained the like bloody Maximes, that the pouder Traytors did. All the Diſloyalty then, which is laid to our charge, is maintaining the Maximes of the Pouder Traytors; in other things we are plainly acknowledged good Subjects.</p>
            <p>Now would I fain know, what this Form of his contributes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards clearing this only charge againſt us. There is not one word of the Pope; and if he, as I think he is, be always underſtood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, unleſs he be expreſly named, as not comprehended in any how general expreſſions ſoever, one may believe of him all which thoſe Traytors believed, and act all they acted, and have no check all the while from any thing ſworn in this Form. There is not one word of the Depoſing Power, the only cauſe of all the jealouſy people have of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53776:92"/> us; which a man may hold, and practiſe all the Diſloyalty which may proceed from it, and ſwear all the Loyalty contain'd in his Form, and never break his Oath. In ſhort, there is not one word whereby it may appear that thoſe, who ſwear Allegiance in this manner, do not maintain in their hearts, and may not practiſe upon occaſion the ſame bloody Maximes, which the Pouder Traytors did, and againſt which the wiſdom of the Nation thought fit to require ſecurity. And, I think, none, but he that has loſt his reaſon, can think they had not reaſon to do ſo. Wherefore, as far as I can perceive, as well as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his Form in behalf of Catholicks, what he has don is to leave all the Diſloyalty, ever charged upon us, ſtill ſticking: and expoſe thoſe, who ſtand reſolutely to it, to the ſuſpicion of being as bad as the worſt Pouder man of them all, which is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to them, and a greater to Religion: as if that did, or could hinder them from giving good evidence that they are not as bad as Traytors.</p>
            <p>The 51 Conſideration has nothing which needs detain us. The Caſe which he ſuppoſes, when it happens, would be as he ſays. But when he applys what may be, to what is, he takes for granted that there is ſomething doubtful, or falſe, or ſome glance at Religion in the Oath of Allegiance, and ſomething more than Civil Allegiance. Which he muſt prove, if he would have thoſe believe, who can find no ſuch thing of themſelves. To be perpetually ſtun'd with the noiſe of Civil Allegiance, and meer Civil Allegiance, and never be ſhewn what there is beſides in the Oath, will ſooner deafen than convince us. No Catholick, who has taken the Oath, ever thought of giving any Spiritual Prerogative to the King by it, or taking any from the Pope. Nor can any man elſe ſee any thing there, but a profeſſion that Subjects are oblig'd to ſtand by their King with their Lives and Fortunes, as the Laws of God, and Nature, and the Land require, and this what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pretended for the Pope to the contrary. This neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys, that the Pope cannot Depoſe; for if he could, he would take away the obligation which Subjects have to ſtand by their King, which is the only thing call'd Civil Allegiance. Wherefore ſince he who profeſſes the Pope cannot take away the obligation of Civil Allegiance, profeſſes no Spiritual matter, but barely his tye to perform Civil Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and nothing elſe, and the Oath contains nothing but this ſubſtance brancht into ſeveral particulars: I cannot perceive any colour of maintaining that the Oath contains more than meer Civil Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53776:92"/> Who will ſay otherwiſe, muſt of neceſſity ſay that Civil Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in caſe of Depoſition, is not Civil Allegiance: which, I think, is plain contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 52. He objects againſt himſelf the Authority of <hi>France,</hi> which he takes a great deal of pains to ſhew has never approved the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oath of Allegiance. I know not why he would put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all that trouble, to confute no body. For he acknowledges that his Adverſarys do not pretend any ſuch thing, as indeed it were not reaſonable they ſhould: every body knowing that the <hi>French</hi> Nation never had authentically approved our Oath, and few expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ever they will.</p>
            <p>For one Nation does not uſe to meddle with the Acts of another, except with ſuch as they find to their prejudice: and if they did, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would have but ſmall thanks for their labour. The World is ſomething jealous, and apt enough to ſuſpect, where Neighbours thruſt themſelves unneceſſarily into their Neighbours concerns, that they ſeek their own good more than theirs. Beſides, who can tell whether the <hi>French,</hi> or any other Nation, may not be well enough content, to have the depoſing Doctrine take root any where, but among themſelves? It has afforded pretences, of which people have taken hold to their advantage. As long as they provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I can hardly think they will be forward to renounce any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of advantage, which others take. Whatever be their reaſon, 'tis certain, there is no National Act of that Kingdom, which has approved our Oath of Allegiance, nor was it ever pretended there was.</p>
            <p>What has been pretended, is, that within the body of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church there are, and thoſe conſiderable both for number and quality, who openly in the face of the World diſown the depoſing Doctrin: and that without reprehenſion, remaining good Catholicks, and acknowledg'd for ſuch by all other Catholicks, even the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And ſo much is evidently true. From hence, people upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion draw ſuch conſequences as they find to their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe, I conceive, are undeniably plain: That the depoſing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not a point of Faith: That who denys it, does not ſtand alone: And that, who refuſes the Oath of Allegiance only for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Doctrine, refuſes it for a reaſon which many Learned Men judge to be no reaſon. It is like enough he may find it to be no reaſon himſelf, if their Authority move him to examin what they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53776:93"/> have to ſay for themſelves. And he may alſo find that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as material objected againſt the Oath. And ſo their declaring againſt the depoſing Doctrine may be, and is an approbation of the Oath, to him who ſees there is not any thing beſides, for which it can rationally be diſapproved. But otherwiſe, ſtanding purely to the force of the Terms; <hi>They have declared againſt depoſing, therefore they have approved the Oath;</hi> is a conſequence which no body makes, and whereof he needed not ſo often inculcate the weakneſs.</p>
            <p>There is enough to be ſaid on every Conſideration; but while none hits the mark, I think 'tis loſt time to meaſure how far every ſhot is wide or ſhort. Only whereas he inſinuates as if the Authority of <hi>France</hi> might be alledged againſt the Oath: becauſe in an Aſſembly of the Eſtates, an Article propos'd by the third Order againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Power was rejected: I muſt intreat his good leave to believe, that in ſuch Aſſemblies things are not carried altogether in the ſame manner as in Schools. <hi>True,</hi> or <hi>Falſe,</hi> is not the only matter in which they are concern'd. They look as much, perhaps more, upon <hi>Expedient,</hi> or <hi>not Expedient.</hi> That the Aſſembly judg'd it unfit to enact the Law propos'd, appears by their rejecting it. And if there were nothing elſe, there was this to make them judge ſo, that they had loſt a Friend of the Pope; with whom perhaps at that time it concern'd them to hold good correſpondence. But that they judged the Article falſe, we cannot know unleſs they had enacted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What Cardinal <hi>Peron</hi> ſaid to them on that occaſion, if he ſaid what goes about in his Name, every body may eaſily ſee, and judge of. If this Gentleman think his Arguments efficacious, he may make uſe of them if he pleaſe; and ſhew us, what we cannot ſee of our ſelves, that they are ſo. In the mean time, who thinks they judged the Article, which they rejected, falſe, muſt of neceſſity think they judged the contradictory true. Let him who thinks ſo, make the experiment, and maintain the contradictory in <hi>France,</hi> viz. <hi>That there is ſome Power on Earth, which has right over the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Kings of</hi> France, <hi>to diſpoſe them,</hi> &amp;c. and if he ſcape the Fate of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> people will be more diſpos'd to be of his mind. But I am much miſtaken, if publick Juſtice do not convince him, that they are for the Doctrine of the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and neither rejected their own, nor forbear to approve ours, for any thing ſaid in either, againſt Depoſition.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:53776:93"/>
            <p>Of this, it ſeems, this Gentleman was aware, and therefore <hi>Num.</hi> 57. begins to find what other faults he can with the Oath. The firſt is the <hi>word Heretical,</hi> an Inn at which every body baits. He touches the ſore wondrous gently, ſaying only, <hi>it ſeems hard to cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. as if things did not often ſeem other than they are, and the greateſt Truths were not hard enough ſometimes. Since he does not give any reaſon ſo much as why it ſeems hard, I conceive it will be enough to refer the Reader to what I have ſaid of this matter in the ſecond Treatiſe: where he will find that <hi>Heretical, or not Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> is not the point, but <hi>Depoſe, or not Depoſe.</hi> Who allows the Pope cannot depoſe, cannot avoid allowing that the propoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't by the Oath is undeniable and unexcuſable Hereſie, and that even in the principles of thoſe who are againſt the Oath. There in truth it only pinches, the reſt has no difficulty but what we make our ſelves. What he adds of <hi>cenſuring the Defenders,</hi> is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his own making, with which the Oath meddles not, and which therefore need not be made, whatever it be when it is. And yet I ſee no great harm would come of it though it were. To cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Men of eſteem, and that deſervedly, for Hereticks, or as bad, ſounds indeed ſcurvily. And I ſuppoſe he meant to work upon the averſion which we naturally have from doing ſo. But when this <hi>Hereſie</hi> with its frightful ſound, ſignifies no more than material He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, it will hardly amount to a reproach. At leaſt many an honeſt Man is liable to it, ſuch as it is, and peradventure few, even among the moſt Holy, and moſt Learned, entirely free.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Sect.</hi> pretends it cannot be ſworn with Truth, <hi>That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope nor any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By the ſincerity which is to be expected from one who writes for the ſatisfaction of peoples Conſciences, does he himſelf truly think this is the Abſolution meant, and renounc't by the Oath? Does he think Proteſtants ſo ignorant, as not to know ſuch Caſes may happen, and ſo wicked as, when they take the Oath themſelves, to ſwear that what they know may be done, cannot be done? He knows as well as any body, that his Caſes have nothing to do with what he himſelf, and all the World beſides underſtands by Abſolution. Not but that the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience to a Prince may ceaſe by ſuch ways, and a great many more. Death may take away, or ſickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If he will by way of Metaphor apply the word <hi>Abſolution</hi> to ſuch caſes, he may if he pleaſes. But when he knows the Oath does not mean ſo, he muſt needs know too, that his Abſolution and the Oath's Abſolution agree no more than Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and not-Abſolution, and that ſuch difficulties are a great deal more likely to perplex than ſatisfie our Conſciences.</p>
            <p>The 59 Conſideration has a very ſurprizing exception againſt the word <hi>Heartily.</hi> It ſeems he finds reluctance himſelf, and meaſures other folks Corn by his own Buſhel. Otherwiſe, that people ſhould boggle at doing their Duty heartily, is very ſtrange. Here again it pinches juſt where it did before; the Exception in truth being, not to the <hi>Heartily,</hi> but the <hi>Duty.</hi> For who believes the Oath contains nothing but Allegiance, muſt believe it his duty to take it, when le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally required; ſince none can doubt but to profeſs and give ſecurity of his Allegiance, is as much his duty as to perform it. Who think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, may indeed be ſtartled at the word <hi>Heartily,</hi> but 'tis becauſe by miſtake they judge what does belong to their Duty, not to do ſo. Wherefore they ſhould ſet the Sadle on the right Horſe, and inſted of blaming the Oath, blame their own thoughts, and thoſe deluſions which have caus'd them. For ſure they cannot expect a Prince ſhould be well ſatisfi'd with thoſe who obey his juſt Commands grudgingly and repiningly.</p>
            <p>But why muſt every body needs feel a reluctance in this buſineſs? Becauſe, ſays he, <hi>they are forced to ſwear, to preſerve advantages, or avoid penalties.</hi> As if all Laws, both of God and man, were not inforc'd upon us in the ſame manner. Heaven and Hell are ſet before our eyes to allure us to obey, and fright us from breaking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God. Temporal Rewards and Puniſhments are propoſed with the ſame deſign in human Laws. According to him, neither One nor Other could be obey'd heartily. Then <hi>great Difficulties have been raiſed, and many Learned men are againſt the Oath.</hi> This we ſhall believe when we ſee it. If thoſe which he calls great Difficulties be ſuch as we meet with here, he muſt pardon us if we have not the ſame opinion of them. For to us they appear very ſlight. And for the Learned men he ſpeaks of, 'tis true, that diverſe who have the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Learning, and who in other matters may deſerve it too, for ought I know are againſt the Oath. But we can ſee nothing in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53776:94"/> their Arguments anſwerable to that reputation, and ſuſpect when they came to treat of this point they left ſome of their Learning behind them. However it be, ſure I am that Reaſons have force from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not their Authors. A good one is a good one out of <hi>John Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s mouth, and a bad one a bad one out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s. I ſhall be eaſily brought to believe, he is a Learned man who proves what he ſays; but if he do not prove what he would, let him be as learned as he will, I conceive, he deſerv'd not that name for what he has don in that point. As for the ſhare which the Supreme Paſtor has in the buſineſs, I hope enough has been ſaid already to ſhew he has don nothing which can hinder a man from taking the Oath very heartily.</p>
            <p>Unleſs the Proverb be falſe, and every Wood will ſerve to make a Mercury, one would not have ſuſpected the Objection he has found, <hi>Sect.</hi> 60. The Title of the Act, wherein the Oath of Allegiance is inſerted, being <hi>For the diſcovering and ſuppreſſing of Popiſh Recuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts,</hi> it <hi>ſeems thereby,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to be inſinuated that the taking this Oath is made a denyal of the Roman Catholick Religion.</hi> 'Tis well for him this is not true; if it were, Catholicks would be obliged to take it as faſt as they can. For if to take the Oath be judged to renounce Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, the Doctrin renounc't by the Oath would certainly be judged to belong to Religion. And then to refuſe the Oath would be to declare that the Depoſing Doctrin is truly a part of Religion. This peradventure he may with a ſafe Conſcience do, who believes that Doctrin to be an Article of Faith, if he can acquit himſelf for believing ſo. But for the reſt, if they conſent to it, they conſent to have it thought their Religion teaches, not only what it does not teach, but what they judge in their Conſcience is falſe, and pernicious. And that is to be manifeſtly guilty of ſcandal, and the greateſt of ſcandals, to Religion; in which, I think, no Pretence, nor Authority, no not of an Angel from Heav'n, can bear them out. Wherefore either all muſt hold the Depoſing Doctrin is a down-right point of Faith, (as indeed it ſticks only there all along) or what he has ſaid to fright us from the Oath, is the ſtrongeſt Motive that can be to take it. No Catholick who thinks otherwiſe, being able to anſwer it at the great day, when it is made a diſtinctive ſign of his Religion, to allow that his Religion teaches falſe and pernicious Doctrin, if he do not unmake that ſign, by all the ways he can, and undeceive his Neighbors, and remove the ſcandal.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53776:95"/>
            <p>But I muſt own the Truth, and ſay there is no ſuch thing, as what to him ſeems to be inſinuated. And it is the ſtranger he ſhould miſs it himſelf, when his next words acknowledge, that <hi>other things are contained in the Act, which do contribute to the diſcovery of Popiſh Recuſants.</hi> For this methinks might have inſinuated, that the Title may properly enough relate to thoſe other things. Yet the Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſerted among the reſt, he will needs have this <hi>complete the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of them.</hi> As if it were not uſual for things of ſeveral natures to be inſerted into the ſame Act, or one Title would comprehend All, without being as long as the Act it ſelf. Beſides, when a Bill is brought into Parliament, it is often ſo altered upon debate, that little remains of the firſt draught, beſides the Title. But the matter is not left to our incertain gueſſes. The end deſign'd by the Oath is expreſly declared to be, not to diſcover Catholicks; but, <hi>for the better Tryal how his Majeſty's Subjects ſtand affected in point of Loyalty, and due Obedience.</hi> And when an Act explains it ſelf, there is no room for private Gloſſes; which if they ſay the ſame, are needleſs; the ſence of the Act being plain before; and if they differ, muſt needs wreſt and injure it, and ought not to be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt publick Authority.</p>
            <p>But he concludes, that 'tis <hi>not lawful to do any thing which is by publick Authority made a denyal of true Religion, or a diſtinctive ſign of a falſe one.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange he ſhould think by dint of Argument to make that paſs for a diſtinctive ſign, which he himſelf, and all the World beſides knows is not a diſtinctive ſign. Can publick Authority be thought to look upon thoſe who take the Oath, as not-Catholicks, which treats them ſtill as Catholicks, and keeps them liable to all the penaltys to which Catholicks are liable? I muſt confeſs I wiſh it would think fit to do otherwiſe. For I think Laws would not be the worſe obey'd, if people were encouraged in their obedience. But this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I humbly leave to their Wiſdom. Does he or any Man think thoſe Catholick Lords who took the Oath, deny'd their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and are not Catholicks ſtill? Do not we find our ſelves actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bred up Catholicks by our Anceſtors, who by taking the Oath in former times according to him, were all turn'd Proteſtants? It is very unexpected that inſinuating, and that but ſeemingly, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove at laſt into a confident aſſertion of what is ſo notoriouſly not true; and a very unlikely means, I think, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who deſire information.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:53776:95"/>
            <p>The 61. Conſideration, excepts againſt ſome ambiguous expreſſions in the Oath, but tells us not which they are. Now all my fear is, that the true exception is, that they are too plain. The exception which the Pope, and thoſe who write againſt the Oath in places where they may ſpeak freely, take to the Oath, is not ambiguity. Here it is a leſs offenſive pretence, than downright maintaining the depoſing Doctrine: and becauſe it carrys ſome ſhew of tenderneſs of Conſcience, finds thoſe who ſincerely love Peace, diſpos'd to gratifie it. For which reaſon, I ſuppoſe, the Authors he cites, ſay what they did. But when this ambiguity comes to be examined, as far as I ſee, the ſubſtance of the Oath is meant by it; and, till the ſecurity which the Wiſdom of the Nation has thought fit to require, be taken away, either that, or ſomething elſe will always be pretended. If it truly ſtick with this Gentleman at ambiguity, let him, if he pleaſe, ſay more plainly what he knows, as ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as it is, the Oath means; and then blame the Oath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for me. But till then, 'tis an exception againſt I know not what; and of any ſhould not be made by him, who, inſtead of this ambiguous Form, offers another more ambiguous a great deal.</p>
            <p>He cloſes this matter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 62. with a pair of exceptions more, whereof the firſt is eaſily compounded. For the Oath requires no more than what he ſtands upon, That what is ſworn be true in the Conſcience of the Swearer, and goes no farther. The point having been already diſcourſed in the ſecond Treatiſe, it is needleſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it over again. The ſecond is, <hi>That there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> neceſſity of Swearing, or any good to be got by it.</hi> As if any obligation impos'd by Law, and requir'd by the Magiſtrate, were not neceſſity enough to juſtifie the taking of an Oath. And as if more good were to be expected from it, than the diſcharge of our duty. Though if there were, Liberty, I ſhould think, and Eſtate may paſs for Goods, among thoſe who are not too ſcrupulouſly nice. But it becomes not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſtand capitulating with their Superiors, what they ſhall get by their obedience before they obey. And this too has been toucht before. Then he concludes, <hi>That the Authority of</hi> France <hi>does not clear nor touch the aforementioned difficulties.</hi> To which I ſhall only ſay, he much over-rates his difficulties. There needs no Authority of <hi>France,</hi> nor any place elſe, to clear what has nothing to be cleared; as I think every body will ſee theſe, he calls difficulties, have not.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53776:96"/> Wherefore he muſt permit me to conclude from theſe very difficulties of his, that there is no true difficulty againſt the Oath, but the perſwaſion that the Pope can depoſe. For ſince for our ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he has made it his buſineſs to find other difficulties, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together as many as he could think of, and produces none but theſe; we have reaſon to think there are no other; and theſe we can, without Spectacles from <hi>France,</hi> ſee, with our own eyes, are not difficulties.</p>
            <p>What follows in ſeveral Paragraphs, is but the ſame over again: That his difficulties have not been toucht, nor the Oath in particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; and then the difference betwixt ſwearing poſitively, and Teaching or Exhorting. All which have been diſcourſt already. His <hi>Probabiliy,</hi> which, <hi>Sect.</hi> 66. he ſays, ceaſes by a ſentence of the Supreme Judge, I leave him to diſpute with the Curates of <hi>France.</hi> It is a point in which I am not verſt, nor mean to be. All I ſwear in the Oath of Allegiance, is, to my beſt Judgement true, and ſo much ſerves my turn. What becomes of the <hi>Probable</hi> I am not concern'd. The caſe he puts, <hi>Sect.</hi> 67. determined by Supreme Authority, is very true; but when he applies it, he ſuppoſes the Pope is the proper Judge of our queſtion; which, to our apprehenſion, ſince it concerns the Authority, and Security of the King, belongs to the King. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it would have done well if he had proved his ſuppoſition, before he had inſulted over the Defenders for <hi>Loſing Talkers.</hi> 'Tis well for them, that the Impugners were gainers by it. For our parts ſo we loſe not the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall be contented with our lot. But 'tis ſtrange to me this Topic ſhould return ſo often. We never were condemn'd more authentically than the Janſeniſts in <hi>France,</hi> nor did the Oath of Allegiance ever make ſo much noiſe and buſtle as the <hi>Five Propoſitions,</hi> and the <hi>Formulaire.</hi> And yet thoſe Heretical Janſeniſts, have liv'd to ſee themſelves thought and created as good Catholicks again, without diſcarding any opinion they had. And when Providence pleaſes, we for all their big words may be on the right ſide, and think ſtill as we do. In the mean time, if the Pope have given ſentence for the Impugners, the King has done the ſame for the Defenders. If the Queſtion belong to his Tribunal, the Defenders after all are the gainers, and the Impugners take the Loſers leave to talk.</p>
            <p>And I ſhould think, as much reaſon as they have had to forbear Printing, it may be worth the while to ſhew it does not belong to his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53776:96"/> Tribunal. For otherwiſe whether a King can be un-king'd or no, a body would think at firſt ſight does ſomething concern a King and his Tribunal. However, it would be a better reaſon for Printing than he gives, <hi>viz.</hi> to get the Oath condemn'd, which every body knows was condemn'd before Pen was ſet to Paper.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be unconcern'd in the 68 Conſideration, if the Diſcourſe did not ſeem to unravel what is weaved in anſwer to the <hi>Second Treatiſe.</hi> Theſe two Oaths, he ſays, are very different: <hi>I judge the Pope has no Power,</hi> and <hi>He has no Power.</hi> This is true, and yet that difference hinders not the ſecond from amounting to <hi>I judge he has no Power</hi> too. But in the former way of expreſſion, the judgment may, and is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be ſlight, and unſetled, and conſcious the object may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as 'tis judged. And this they mean who ſay, <hi>I think ſuch a thing is true, but will not ſwear it.</hi> In the ſecond way, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is firm, and for as much as the ſwearer is conſcious, abſolutely certain the object is as 'tis judged. And ſo, becauſe what is <hi>ſeen, is,</hi> it is all one to ſay <hi>It is,</hi> or <hi>I ſee it.</hi> Yet even when I ſay <hi>It is ſo,</hi> I am not underſtood to ſay more than <hi>I judge it is ſo,</hi> with a firm, and to my conſcience, certain judgment, becauſe all the World knows I can ſay no more. For I cannot ſay <hi>It is,</hi> but in vertue of my ſight that it is, and that ſight is my judgment.</p>
            <p>'Tis not then, as I conceive, the matter alone, but the matter <hi>as ſeen,</hi> which is the object of poſitive Oaths; and the judgment always makes a part, and a principal part of the object. For the matter may be true, and I be perjur'd by ſwearing it, if I judge it not true; as likewiſe the matter may be falſe, and I not perjur'd by ſwearing it, if I judge it true on ſufficient Motives. Whence, I think, 'tis plain, that the Judgment, not the matter, is the principal thing in Oaths however expreſſed. What he ſays to the contrary, <hi>That 'tis poſſible one ſhould ſwear falſe, thinking he ſwears true,</hi> which could not be if the Judgment were the object, becauſe every one certainly knows his own Judgment is true, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not true, as he underſtands <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Swearing falſe.</hi> If by ſwearing falſe be meant, that the matter ſworn may be falſe, undoubtedly he may ſwear falſe who thinks he ſwears true. But if by ſwearing falſe, be meant Perjury, then who thinks he ſwears true, provided the grounds of ſuch thinking be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, cannot ſwear falſe. Again, by <hi>Judgment</hi> may be meant ſuch a one as he mentions, which ſo judges the matter ſworn is true, as probably to know withal that it may be otherwiſe. Who ſwears in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53776:97"/> that manner that a thing is poſitively true, not only may, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in danger to ſwear falſe, and therefore I think, with him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſwear without an affront to God; though he knows we have grave Authors againſt us, who will have probability ſerve turn. But if the Judgment neither know, nor doubt any probability, or even poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that the matter ſworn may be otherwiſe, and be ſetled on Motives which render his miſtake, if he do miſtake, unblamable before God and Man, I conceive he cannot be guilty of Perjury, or affront to God, who ſwears even what after appears falſe. Much of this has been ſaid already, and perhaps needed not be repeated now. For after all, what he aſſumes at laſt, That <hi>we are</hi> in the Oath of Allegiance <hi>bound to ſwear poſitively that the Pope has no ſuch Power,</hi> is confuted by the expreſs words of the Oath, which plainly relate to the Conſcience, and Belief, or Judgment of the Swearer.</p>
            <p>The three following Conſiderations have little to do with the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; no body, that I know, making the Conſequence which he ſays is weak. I can only wonder in paſſing, what Adverſaries he means by thoſe who ſeem to have an eye to the Articles of the Faculty of <hi>Paris. Withrington</hi> was dead, the <hi>Reflections,</hi> and <hi>Queſtions</hi> writ, before thoſe Articles appeared. I ſuppoſe they were no Prophets to have an eye to future things, and which were not yet to be ſeen. The The Jeſuites, too, are brought in, unreaſonably enough in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Concerning whom I ſhall only ſay, that if what he tell us be true, <hi>That who among them ſhould teach the Depoſing Doctrin would be ſeverely puniſht;</hi> They are wrong'd to be made the Authors of theſe Treatiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 72. He begins to ſpeak of the condemnation of <hi>Santarellus,</hi> a ſubject which takes up ſeveral <hi>Sections.</hi> What he ſays here, is, that interpreting that Decree, as ſome do the Oath, <hi>as erroneous, &amp;c.</hi> may ſignifie <hi>as bad as erroneous, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo the Doctor; who condemned <hi>Santarellus,</hi> cannot be concluded to have thought that Doctrin erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; nay may be concluded to have thought it not erroneous. I conceive thoſe Doctors are to be askt what they meant by their <hi>As</hi> in their Cenſure, and the Parliament in the Oath, not knowing who elſe can tell. But whatever the Parliament meant, if it were put to his Conſcience, I do not think he believes in earneſt the Doctors thought the Doctrin, which they condemn'd as erroneous, was not erroneous. I conceive alſo, that ſince he diſlikes this interpretation in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, he might have forborn it himſelf, eſpecially knowing that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53776:97"/> 
               <hi>Withrington,</hi> though he borrow'd that Anſwer from the Doctrin of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> yet relys himſelf more on another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 73. He ſays the Cenſures and Propoſitions being ſeveral, it does not well appear which falls upon which. The Cenſure runs thus: <hi>The Faculty diſapproves, and condemns the Doctrin contained in thoſe Propoſitions.</hi> Which, ſince there is no <hi>Reſpective</hi> to render the ſence indeterminate, ſignifies, I think, that all the Cenſures fall upon the Doctrin of all the Propoſitions. Yet it <hi>ſeems incredible to him that thoſe Learned men ſhould ſo hardly cenſure this Propoſition,</hi> which makes one among them: The Pope may with Temporal Puniſhments cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe Princes for the Crime of Hereſie, ſeeing the <hi>Pope, or any Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius may impoſe ſome Corporal and Temporal Puniſhment; for example to give Alms, or build an Hoſpital,</hi> upon an Heretical Prince who <hi>ſhould come to be reconciled.</hi> Truly he is ſomething harder of belief than St. <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf, if he cannot believe that may be don, which he ſees is don. He may diſpute it out with them if he pleaſe: To me his Reaſon ſeems as ſtrange as his Incredulity. Thoſe Penances which repentant Sinners receive from their Ghoſtly Fathers, and perform of their own good will, I think are not underſtood by the word <hi>Chaſtiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If you will call them ſo, the penitent chaſtiſes himſelf, but is not chaſtis'd by another. And ſhould he not be willing to do them, neither Ghoſtly Father nor Pope could take away his Mony, to ſpend in Alms, or on an Hoſpital. I think there is no Defender of the Oath, nor any man in his wits, who denys the Pope may chaſtiſe, if you will needs call it ſo, any Prince with the loſs of his Kingdom for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or any thing elſe, whom he can perſwade voluntarily to part with it. But if he will keep it, how it ſhould be taken from him in ſpite of his Teeth, by a Power of impoſing Penances, by which not ſo much as a ſingle penny can be taken from any man without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is beyond our underſtanding. Beſides, Chaſtiſing a Prince for Hereſie, ſignifies proceeding againſt one actually guilty of the fault. When the Propoſition ſpeaks of ſuch a one, who would have thought it had been to purpoſe to ſpeak of one who comes to be reconciled, and by doing ſo declares he is not ſuch a one? Becauſe the one may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd whatever is for the good of his Soul, will it follow, the other may be depriv'd of his Temporal Rights?</p>
            <p>The 74. <hi>Sect.</hi> tells us, <hi>Spondanus</hi> ſays, <hi>the Book of</hi> Santarellus <hi>was forbid at</hi> Rome, <hi>before it was forbid at</hi> Paris; as if it imported whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were or no. I can ſay nothing of that Prohibition, having
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53776:98"/> never ſeen it. The Authour of the Preface to theſe Treatiſes it ſeems has. He is his Man, if he have a mind to make a buſineſs of it. He adds out of the ſame Authour, that <hi>the Animoſities of the Univerſity of</hi> Paris, <hi>aroſe from ſome hidden ſeeds of Schiſm:</hi> A ſtory which does not tell well. For if they were hidden, how came <hi>Spondanus</hi> to ſee them? There appears nothing but the cenſure, and I hope he has not a mind to aſperſe the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſeeds of Schiſm, by making the prohibition of <hi>Santarellus</hi> a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe for the ſuſpicion. What he gathers from thoſe promiſes, has been ſo often ſaid, that I am quite weary of repeating. No body infers the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> is for the Oath. But every body, that has eyes, ſees they cannot be again the Oath, for renouncing the depoſing power which they renounce themſelves: And that other quarrels againſt it are too frivolous, to trouble ſo famous an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity with them.</p>
            <p>The 75. <hi>Sect.</hi> would have the <hi>Paris</hi> cenſure underſtood of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for ſlighter cauſes, or at moſt for Hereſie in the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without enforcing it on their Subjects. And this he ſays, is different from our preſent caſe, becauſe we ſwear in the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, the Pope cannot depoſe a Prince for any cauſe, even though he perſecute his Subjects into his own Hereſie. Undoubtedly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Title ſay, he was no Jeſuit who writ this. For to except againſt the Oath, becauſe it renounces depoſing Power in all caſes, is to teach it in ſome; and that he has told us is puniſhable among them. I hope he does not expect a point of ſuch conſequence ſhould be yielded on the credit of his word. When he brings his proofs, we ſhall ſee how far they will carry. In the mean time, the cenſure ſpeaking ſo plainly as it does, I conceive it very needleſs to inquire, what it means, of Comments leſs clear than the Text. The 76. <hi>Sect.</hi> diſtinguiſhes betwixt <hi>Heretical,</hi> and <hi>contrary to the word of God;</hi> of which whatever be the Truth, it concerns not us. For what is in the Oath renounc't as Heretical, is undeniable, and unexcuſable Hereſie, unleſs the depoſing Doctrine be true. Who ſais it is not Hereſie, muſt of neceſſity ſay his King is ſubject to a ſuperiour power, which may dethrone him: And that I conceive is a Doctrine no more currant among other Men than among the Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Conſiderations he makes on the cenſure of <hi>Santarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> not likely, as far as I ſee, to pull down the price which his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarys, he ſays, ſet upon it. For 'tis a plain caſe the Doctrine of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53776:98"/> the Impugners of the Oath is condemn'd by that cenſure; not in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, as the Oath, and Writings of the Defenders, but particularly and expreſly. As great as the cry is againſt it, I do not know that ſo much can be ſaid of the Doctrine of the Defenders. Their Books indeed are ſome of them condemn'd, and people gueſs they are condemn'd for that Doctrine. But till I ſee it, I can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Propoſition, <hi>The Pope cannot depoſe,</hi> which is the ſum of their Doctrine, has ever been authentically cenſured for erroneous, contrary to the word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet in ſo many Univerſities as there are in Chriſtendom, it is much if there be not ſome ready enough to gratifie the Pope in ſuch a buſineſs, if he ſhould deſire it. But at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they underſtand the World better, I durſt wager they neither have, nor will in haſte, be Authours of ſuch a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves.</p>
            <p>Having already in the ſecond Treatiſe met with the great miſtake he talks of <hi>Sect.</hi> 77. I think I have ſaid enough there to ſhow it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be repeated. The reſt has no difficulty. In the 78. he undertakes a buſineſs, with which if he can go through, he ſhall have it, by my conſent, of all that ever writ againſt the Oath. 'Tis to ſhew, <hi>That an Indirect, and conditional Power to depoſe Kings (which ſome aſcribe to the Pope in certain caſes) is not inconſiſtent with Prerogatives</hi> claim'd by the <hi>French</hi> King, and confeſt to be in the King of <hi>England.</hi> His reaſon is, <hi>becauſe every King has an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and conditional Power, or Right, to wage War againſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and depoſe him, and abſolve their Subjects from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him,</hi> if the War be juſt. <hi>And the Pope being a Temporal Prince as well as the reſt, has the ſame Power, on Right which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have.</hi> I cannot tell which of the two is more ſurpriſing, the thing to be proved, or the proof. Thoſe who have hitherto appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Indirect</hi> Power, have deriv'd it from the office of Supreme Paſtor in the Pope; and the impoſſibility of executing it as it ought, without the power of depoſing: and therefore, rejecting the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power of the Canoniſts, will needs perſwade us it is Spiritual, even when it meddles with Temporals. This new Invention derives it from that rank which by time and accidents, out-vy any Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Chriſt, Popes now a days hold on the World, and leaving the <hi>Pope,</hi> conſiders only the <hi>Temporal Prince.</hi> As if this were that, which the Defenders of <hi>Indirect</hi> Power aſcribe to the Pope, or what he has in vertue of his Temporalties could be thought Spiritual.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53776:99"/> Poor St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thoſe Popes who were not Temporal Princes, are now quite out of dores; and methinks 'tis the oddeſt thing in the World, the Pope ſhould claim as Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been the pretence, by an Argument which leaves St. <hi>Peter</hi> no claim at all. Theſe variable Symptoms, in my opinion, make but a bad Prognoſtick for the Indirect Power. For ſure it ſtands but totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when people cannot tell on what bottom it ſtands, whether Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Temporal.</p>
            <p>The point it ſelf has been diſcourſt before, and the equivocation is ſo obvious, that I wonder to ſee it return again. The power which Kings have over one another, ſignifies nothing but ſtrength; and what he calls Right, is only Reaſon, which directs them when and how to uſe it. Such power and right as this every ſtronger man had over a weaker, when no man had power or right over another, in the ſtate of Nature, before the foundations of Power and Right were ſetled. What is underſtood by that word, by thoſe who are for the <hi>Indirect</hi> Power, implys a relation of Superior and Inferior, whereof one is to command, and the other obey in vertue of that command. So they ſay the Pope, as Supreme Paſtor, has the relation of a Shepherd to his Sheep, and Kings belonging to the flock as well as private men, may command them as well as others. And thus much even Catholick Kings confeſs to be true, if his power be confin'd to that notion in which he is Paſtor. But the Indirect-power-men extend it to Temporals, and ſay it belongs to the office of Supreme Paſtor to diſpoſe of his Sheep in things wherein they are not his Sheep. Whether they ſay well, or ill, which is not now our Queſtion, they plainly maintain a relation of Superiority, and make the Popes Power conſiſt in it. That this Power is inconſiſtent with the Prerogatives of Soveraign Princes, he has ſaved me the labor of ſhewing, by making the Power, which he ſays is not inconſiſtent, another thing: And though he had not, 'tis plain that Soveraignty is not compatible with a Superior. There remains only to be conſidered, in which of the two ſences the word <hi>Power</hi> is underſtood in the Oath of Allegiance.</p>
            <p>And this, I conceive, ſo clear, that I ſhould be content to put it to this Gentleman himſelf. For I cannot believe he thinks ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly of the Framers of the Oath, that they ever dreamt of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to ſwear, that the Pope cannot drive our, or any King, out of his Kingdom, if he be ſtrong enough. He cannot think thoſe who take it ſo wicked, as to ſwear that cannot be don, which they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53776:99"/> know as well as he, may be don, whenever the Pope comes to be ſtronger than the King, and will employ his ſtrength that way. He cannot think the wiſdom of a Nation, which for their own ſake he ſhould not think altogether fooliſh, ſhould ſolemnly vote, and oblige all to ſwear, a Foreign Prince cannot aſſemble an Army ſtrong enough to over-power us, and think of keeping it out by Oaths and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The Oath ſeems plainly enough to explicate the Power, which it renounces, of Authoritative Power, by the word <hi>Authority</hi> joyn'd to it: but though it had not, I cannot ſee how it can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood otherwiſe, without a very highly prejudic'd animoſity againſt the Oath, to ſay no more.</p>
            <p>I, but <hi>the Propoſition is negative, and by conſequence deny's all Power whatſoever.</hi> As if the words were not always to be underſtood <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſubjectam materiam</hi> as they call it, according to the matter of which they ſpeak, whether the Propoſition be Negative or Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <hi>No man is immortal,</hi> is a Negative Propoſition, and very true, though after the reſurrection all men are immortal. He who ſhould make this exception when every body knows of what men the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſpeaks, would be thought a Caviller for his pains. Again, <hi>All men breath,</hi> is a true Affirmative; and yet Children in their Mother's womb, and painted men breath not. And painted men (for of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren there is no difficulty) are as truly men, as the power of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes is the Depoſing Power the Oath ſpeaks of. But all this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be eaſily compounded. Let him but ſwear, and that only according to his Conſcience and the beſt of his Judgment, that the Pope has no power to Depoſe, with a plain declaration that he means not by his Oath to exclude any power which the Pope has, as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, but only that which ſome aſcribe to him as Head of the Church, and I am much miſtaken in Proteſtants, if they do not accept his Oath, and deſire no more. But if he refuſes this, people, I ſuſpect, will be apt to think what he ſays here is not that which truly ſticks, and that 'tis with the Oath, as Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi>'s Watch, ſo it be wound up, no matter by what hand or trick.</p>
            <p>As to the Queſtion he <hi>cannot but ask, Sect.</hi> 79. I muſt acknowledge my ignorance. I underſtand not King-Craft, and the Laws of Peace and War enough, to be able to anſwer it, and reſolve him whether Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be a juſt cauſe of War. I think Divines are not agreed about it, and I have the leſs curioſity to ſtudy the point, becauſe I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it not a jot material. For that a King may be diſpoſſeſt by the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53776:100"/> Pope, either alone, or leagued with others, is, I conceive, as much as needs to his purpoſe. Whether the War be juſt, or unjuſt imports not; and if it did, it is plain there are other cauſes, beſides Religion, which make a War juſt, and every body knows the Pope, being a Temporal Prince, may interpoſe in any War he pleaſes upon any juſt account, as any other Temporal Prince may interpoſe in a War for Religion as well as he. To gratifie this Gentleman then, I will allow that Religion may be a juſt cauſe of War; That the Pope may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in it all the ways he has thought of; in ſhort, I will grant all he asks, and take the Liberty to believe any man notwithſtanding may ſafely ſwear, <hi>The Pope neither by himſelf, nor with any other, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> any Power, or Authority to Depoſe our King, or Authorize any Foreign Prince to invade or annoy Him or his Countrys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already ſaid why the Power, in vertue whereof Princes make War upon one another, and the Depoſition enſuing, cannot be the Power and Depoſition renounc't by the Oath. There remains only to conſider, whether <hi>Invoking</hi> be <hi>Authorizing;</hi> which I cannot but wonder he would ſo far ſtrain his credit with his Readers as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon them. Many are <hi>Authoriz'd</hi> themſelves, and know by experience what the word means; the reſt know it, as well as they, even by not being in Authority. All ſee that who is <hi>Authoriz'd,</hi> is, by being ſo, enabled to do ſomething which before he could not do, and which thoſe cannot who are not authoriz'd. A Juſtice can examin and commit men, a Judge try and condemn them; and ſo every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer whether Civil or Military, can act as he is empowr'd by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as long as it laſts; and when it expires or is recall'd, they can do thoſe things no longer. Now 'tis plain, a Prince who is <hi>Invok't</hi> by the Pope, or any body elſe, (for others may Invoke as well as he) can do nothing which he could not do before he was Invok't, and which he might not have don, if he pleaſed, whether he had been Invok't or no. He gets neither Men, nor Money, nor Arms, nor any increaſe of Power to make War. Neither does Invocation make the quarrel juſt. There was either breach of Treaty, or Religion, if you will, or ſome other of the cauſes which makes War juſt, which Invocation does not put, but find, and urges the Prince to proceed upon. If there were not, he is plainly call'd to an unjuſt War; if there were, he might have juſtly undertaken it without any body's Invocation.</p>
            <p>Manifeſtly then, <hi>Authorizing</hi> is giving another ſome power which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53776:100"/> he had not before: <hi>Invoking</hi> is only ſolliciting him to uſe the power he has of himſelf. Which being ſo, as every body ſees it is, there is no ſhadow of reaſon, why the Liberty which the Pope has, and others have as well as he, of <hi>Invoking,</hi> ſhould hinder us from ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he cannot <hi>Authorize</hi> a Foreign Prince to invade the King. And ſo if you will grant this Gentleman, that the power by which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Princes proceed againſt one another, is the Power of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that to ſolicite one of them to uſe this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is to give it him, he has then ſomething to ſay againſt the Oath of Allegiance. But ſince we cannot but ſee they are as different as may be, and yet not more different from one another than from the meaning of the Oath, we cannot but wonder how he ſhould light on ſuch ſcruples himſelf, and more, how he ſhould offer them to us for ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The 80<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> conſideration tells us, that every Church or Kingdom has not the ſame Priviledges or Liberties <hi>which are granted to the Gallican Church by particular conceſſions of the Pope, or contract, or otherwiſe:</hi> as if the Rights in queſtion were claim'd by grant from the Pope, or Soveraigns held of any but God, or could, without ceaſing to be Soveraigns. They may derive their Liberties from whence they pleaſe in <hi>France;</hi> the Crown of <hi>England is,</hi> and <hi>at all times has been free in all things touching the Regality of the ſame, and in no Earthly ſubjection to any but God,</hi> ſays the Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But neither is it true, that the <hi>French</hi> look upon their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, as Priviledges for which they are beholding to the Pope. A little Treatiſe of the Liberties of the Gallican Church, Printed by <hi>Patiſſon,</hi> 1594. with Licence from the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> lays for a foundation, that <hi>what their Fathers ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> the Liberties of the Gallican Church, are not favours, or exorbitant Priviledges, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural Franchiſes, Freedoms, or common Rights, of which there needs be ſhewn no other Title than Poſſeſſion, and natural enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Again, <hi>Thoſe which are commonly called the Liberties of the Church of</hi> France, ſays another, <hi>are not Priviledges granted by the Pope, but in truth conſiſt in this, That the Church of</hi> France <hi>has not received divers Papal conſtitutions made within Four hundred years,</hi> &amp;c. So that it ſeems the <hi>French</hi> know the difference betwixt Priviledges and Natural Liberties well enough. Whether they do or no, we know what we have received from our Catholick An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and which, by this Gentleman's favour, we mean to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53776:101"/> to our poſterity; let him and the <hi>French</hi> agree about it as they can. Mean time I leave his Priviledges to thoſe whom they concern, as they do not us, even by his own confeſſion.</p>
            <p>For he tells us at laſt, <hi>We have the ſame liberty which the</hi> French <hi>have, in relation to our preſent debate.</hi> And then to what purpoſe are the Liberties of other Nations brought into Queſtion, or our own in other matters? But ſince liberty is given to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to maintain that the Pope has no power to Depoſe Kings, I will take the liberty to ſay, they are alſo at liberty to maintain the Oath of Allegiance. For theſe Treatiſes have made it pretty manifeſt, that nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial can be brought againſt it, but the renouncing that Power. And yet we ſhall hardly take the liberty to maintain Truth, for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to tell us, that though they might take ſuch an Oath as ours in <hi>France,</hi> if they had it to take, yet we in <hi>England</hi> might not for ſeveral reaſons. The firſt inſiſted on <hi>Sect.</hi> 81. is, becauſe <hi>we may prudently ſuſpect</hi> it made <hi>out of hatred and contempt of the Roman Church, the Papal Dignity, and the Popes Supremacy in Spirituals; which becauſe they could not ſo eaſily bring Catholicks to deny explicitely, they intend to make them do implicitely, under a colour of Civil Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</hi> I never pretended much to Prudence, and doubt I never ſhall, if it be Prudence to give way to private ſuſpicions, againſt the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of publick Authority, and to fancy we know their meaning bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they themſelves. Since the Framers of the Oath plainly tell us the end they had in it, I ſhould never have thought it prudent to ſuſpect it was not their end. Neither can I underſtand the cunning of that trick, by which he would make them go about to trepan us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an implicit denyal of the Popes Supremacy in Spirituals. For what would Proteſtants get by it? They know well enough, that though they ſhould have inveigled us into an acknowledgment of ſomething implicitly inconſiſtent with the Popes Spiritual Supremacy, there would not be a Papiſt the leſs for all that. For when ever this implicit inconſiſtency ſhould come to be unfolded, and we urged to renounce that Supremacy, we ſhould deſire them to excuſe us; and tell them, whatever the words may import beyond our intentions, we meant no ſuch matter, and ſtick to our Supremacy ſtill. They know thoſe who take the Oath do it, as well as thoſe who refuſe it: and while we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and ſtand to it, to think they ſhould fancy by a trick to make us all renounce it, and turn Proteſtants againſt our wills, and without our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53776:101"/> knowledge, is a ſuſpicion which, if it have any prudence, I think has but little reaſon.</p>
            <p>But where lies the prudence of ſuſpecting that the Oath was made in contempt of the Pope? <hi>The Framers,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſpecifie no other Temporal Prince, though there be as much need of ſecuring our Loyalty againſt them, as the Pope.</hi> As if every body did not know the Oath was framed upon occaſion of a Treaſon proceeding from a miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Popes Power, not of other Princes. If thoſe Powers were paſt by, of which they ſtood in no fear, and proviſion made againſt that, from which they had newly ſcapt ſo imminent a danger, muſt the Papal dignity be therefore ſuſpected to be contemn'd? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other Princes would be thought contemn'd, as unregarded and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; but to ſtand in fear of the Pope, is no ſign of contempt. However it be, he deſpiſes not Water-men ſure, who takes no care of Boats, and what may ſave from drowning, when the only danger is from Fire.</p>
            <p>I, but <hi>'tis manifeſt, that this was the deſign of the Parliament: For they would have inſerted in the Oath a Renunciation of the Popes power to Excommunicate.</hi> That people ſhould not agree in manifeſt things! I cannot for my life but think the contrary manifeſt. For if having a will to inſert ſuch a Clauſe infer having ſuch a Deſign, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a will to inſert it, infers not having that deſign. And, I think; nothing can be more manifeſt, than that they had not a will to inſert it, when they left it out. By what means they came to be changed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by King <hi>James,</hi> or any other motive, imports not. It is enough that they were changed, when they perfected the Act, and had not the <hi>Will,</hi> which he ſays they had, and therefore had not the <hi>Deſign,</hi> which he infers from that Will. Notwithſtanding, he will needs have enough remaining <hi>to make us prudently ſuſpect the Oath was contriv'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Papal dignity.</hi> Not ſo prudently, I doubt, unleſs he would tell us what this <hi>enough</hi> is. Otherwiſe I ſhould think we may prudently ſuſpect, there is no ſuch thing at all, ſince he, who makes it his buſineſs, can find none. But then, <hi>it is a conſtant opinion among Divines, that we are bound to refuſe a thing, though indifferent in it ſelf, when 'tis required in contempt of a lawful Dignity.</hi> Suppoſe it be, where is the contempt of lawful dignity? He has not proved ſo much as that it can be prudently ſuſpected. To aſſume at laſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that it is, and then run away with it, is by his favor a little too much.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53776:102"/>
            <p>I verily think, he might prudentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> enough have ſpared the whole Conſideration. It proceeds all upon ſuſpicions, no very good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation at beſt. But to make them ſhew a little more handſomely, he calls them <hi>Prudent;</hi> and this prudent in truth ſignifies <hi>unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For there is not one ſo much as likely reaſon of ſuſpicion. And, when he had done, fairly takes for granted, more than he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove, and knocks it on the head with Authority. And this in his Language is <hi>Particular Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Prudent. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a ſecond Reaſon, the diſtinctive ſign returns upon the Stage, <hi>Sect.</hi> 82. as far as I ſee only to act the ſame part over again, there being little added or altered. He will not have the Oath intended by the Framers, to diſtinguiſh Loyal Catholicks from others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>The Title makes no ſuch diſtinction, and the Title he ſuppoſes was put in by thoſe who framed the Act to declare their Intention.</hi> I ſhould never have thought this matter had been worth repeating. By the Act was intended to diſcover and ſuppreſs Popiſh Recuſants, and this intention is declared in the Title, and but too much purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the body of it. In the ſame Act is inſerted an Oath to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Catholicks: and though this intention be as plainly expreſt as the other, this Gentleman would hear us in hand there is no ſuch matter, becauſe it is not expreſt in the ſame place. There needs great power in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hetorick to perſwade us that Law-makers may not explain themſelves where they think fit; and more in Logick to conclude efficaciouſly that their meaning is not their meaning, only becauſe it appears not juſt where he would have it.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon why the Oath cannot be intended to diſtinguiſh Catholicks, is becauſe <hi>we might ſay the ſame of diſtinctive ſigns inſtituted by Pagan Emperours,</hi> viz. <hi>That they likewiſe were to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Loyal Chriſtians.</hi> As if every thing could be ſaid of every thing; and the Oath could not be intended to diſtinguiſh Catholicks, becauſe Pagans intended to make Chriſtians turn Pagans. For the diſtinctive ſigns he ſpeaks of were indeed ſuch, and who comply'd with them, was, both by Pagans and Chriſtians, thought to renounce Chriſtianity. For they were generally to worſhip, or ſacrifice to Idols; which whoever conſented to do, did in the opinion both of Pagans and Chriſtians, become a Pagan. And when they aſperſed Chriſtians with diſloyalty, every body ſaw the aſperſion was unjuſt, and that what they required, to make them paſs for Loyal, was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53776:102"/> that they ſhould ceaſe to be Chriſtians. Now every body ſees that the Oath of Allegiance is not a diſtinctive ſign, ſince every body ſees that who takes it, is not thought leſs a Catholick, either by Proteſtants or Catholicks, than he was before, or than he who refuſes it. So that I cannot but wonder to ſee Catholicks, who remain Catholicks when they do what Proteſtants require, paralell'd with Chriſtians, who did not remain Chriſtians when they yielded to what Pagans required.</p>
            <p>His third reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Proteſtants are perſwaded that the very Principles of our Religion are inconſiſtent with civil Allegiance.</hi> Among intelligent Proteſtants I hope there are not many who are ſo perſwaded. But be it as it will, this perſwaſion of theirs is it true or falſe? I hope he will not ſay it is true, for the ſcandal it is to Religion, which muſt of neceſſity be falſe, and need no ſecond Argument to be proved ſo, if it be indeed inconſiſtent with Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is manifeſtly a duty enjoyn'd by Religion. If it be, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> undoubtedly it is, falſe, they ſhould do well to lay their hands on their Hearts, and conſider on the account they have to make to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, who have contributed to a perſwaſion ſo ſcandalous. I wiſh the Authors of theſe Treatiſes be not concern'd. To ſay nothing of the firſt, who makes the not-depoſing Doctrine flatly erroneous in Faith; this laſt goes farther in this point, than he was perhaps aware of, at leaſt than I know how to anſwer to a good Conſcience. For he would have the Pope obey'd in this matter before the King; and that, ſince Religion is the Sphere of the Pope's activity, is to ſay, that this matter belongs to Religion; which I fear contributes but too much to that perſwaſion. However it be, ſince Proteſtants cannot be ſo perſwaded, but by being perſwaded firſt, that depoſing; Doctrine belongs to Religion, I conceive it is the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Catholick to unperſwade them as faſt as he can, and not ſuffer an aſperſion ſo ſcandalous, and ſo unjuſt to lye upon his Religion.</p>
            <p>Peradventure, no Defender of the Oath has brought a ſtronger Argument for the taking of it, than this zeal againſt it. For 'tis plain, that no pretence of Authority, or any thing elſe can bear us out in any thing to the prejudice of Religion; and 'tis plain, that Religion is prejudic'd, by being expos'd to the ſcandal of teaching Doctrine inconſiſtent with Allegiance. If the depoſing Doctrine be inconſiſtent with Allegiance, and taught by our Religion; 'tis alſo
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53776:103"/> plain that our Religion teaches Doctrin inconſiſtent with Allegiance. Wherefore, unleſs it can be made out that 'tis not inconſiſtent with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, 'tis plainly the duty of a good Catholick to renounce it, when he is legally required. And ſince it appears, by the unſucceſsful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of theſe Treatiſes, that there is no rational exception againſt the Oath but becauſe it renounces that Doctrin, every good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick not only may, but ought take it. For to refuſe it, being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe renouncing that Doctrin, expoſes his Religion to the ſcandal mentioned, for which there neither is, nor can be any warrantable pretence.</p>
            <p>The two following <hi>Sections</hi> only repeat things formerly ſaid; ſave that there is a little touch in the firſt concerning the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> who, I think, have not much to do with our Oath. Yet their caſe, and ours, may in one reſpect be like enough. We have ſeen them a good while traduc'd for Hereticks, and a mighty buſtle made about them, and people alarm'd with fearful dangers hanging over the Church; and now we ſee the ſame men, perſiſting in the ſame ſentiments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd and treated as very good Catholicks. So it may very well happen with the Defenders of the Oath; who for all the paſt heats, and preſent Zeal againſt them, may one day, without any change in their judgments, be as good Catholicks as the beſt. In the mean time this ſuſpicion of his, of the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> adhering to the five Propoſitions, methinks is pleaſant, when they have often enough declared to the World what they hold in that matter, and put it paſt gueſſing, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting.</p>
            <p>In the 85 <hi>Section</hi> there are ſeveral matters ſcatter'd, moſt, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not extraordinarily material. What he would be at, is, that <hi>whatever is produced out of</hi> France <hi>is of little or no force to juſtifie the taking our Oath.</hi> As if it were nothing towards the juſtification of renouncing a Doctrin by the Oath, that the ſame Doctrin is irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly renounc'd by Catholicks in the face of the World. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe <hi>it may prudently be thought that what the</hi> Engliſh <hi>do, may proceed from indignation againſt the Pope, and a deſign to bring off Catholicks by little and little from his obedience, which cannot be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of the</hi> French. I have already ſaid why I conceive thoſe thoughts are not very prudent. But though they were, as long as this ſuſpected indignation and deſign requires no more than may be don with a ſafe conſcience, I cannot think our ſuſpicions can warrant us to diſobey our lawful Magiſtrate, when we may with a ſafe conſcience obey. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53776:103"/> it is not for Subjects to pry into the Commands of their lawful Superiors, but guide themſelves by what appears in publick. The Intention legally declared, is all the Intention of which we are to take notice. If they ſecretly harbour any other in their breaſts, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and their own conſciences, in which we are not concern'd. Now the Intention legally declared, being to diſtinguiſh Loyal Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks from others, we not only may, but ought comply with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſince nothing can be more evidently unreaſonable than that we ſhould expoſe our ſelves to a juſt ſuſpition of Diſloyalty, and our Religion to the ſcandal of obliging us ſo to do. The only difficulty is, whether what they require to this end, be conſiſtent with our duty to God. Who are ſatisfi'd it is, cannot but be ſatisfi'd it is their duty to give the teſtimony of Loyalty, which is legally required, and can never anſwer it to a good conſcience to forbear it, for fear of groundleſly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and not appearing intentions.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, I underſtand neither Caſuiſtry nor Law enough, to know whether the caſe he puts, of two holding by the ſame unjuſt Title, one legally condemn'd, the other not, be well reſolv'd. But I am apt to ſuſpect, that he holds with no very good conſcience, who holds by a Title declared unjuſt. And for what he adds, that 'tis not reaſonable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould expect the ſame liberty with the <hi>French,</hi> I think it not worth the while to examin whether it be reaſonable or no. But methinks it is ſomething croſs to tell us, a few Paragraphs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we have the ſame liberty with the <hi>French,</hi> and now, that 'tis unreaſonable we ſhould.</p>
            <p>The approbation of ſome <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors, which he mentions <hi>Sect.</hi> 86 and 87, is a ſecret to me, as well as him. And I have the leſs cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to inquire after it, becauſe I ſuſpect, by his niceneſs in ſtating the caſe, it is not likely to paſs with him, whatever it be. Nor do I think any thing can be ſo clear, as to ſcape ſuch exceptions as he has already taken. And ſo being come to an end of this matter, I muſt follow his example, and apologize for detaining the Reader ſo long about it. For whatever this Gentleman think, I conceive it not ſo very material, as valuing one good Argument, which diſcovers the truth of the thing, above twenty approbations, even of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bon</hi> Doctors. But yet if I had ſaid nothing, people might have been apt to ſuſpect it had been for want of ſomething to ſay.</p>
            <p>To my great comfort we are now at the laſt Objection, which ſtrives firſt to put them out of credit who are for the Oath. Of theſe he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53776:104"/> ſays, <hi>Sect.</hi> 89. that the Pope gives them a bad character. He had ſpoken to purpoſe, if he had ſhewn they deſerve it; for if they do not, they have but the more wrong. The King gives as bad a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe of the other ſide; and yet this Gentleman, I believe, thinks ne'er a whit the worſe of them. Whatever is ſaid of them, they were conſciencious men who took the Oath, and that is all the Objection ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 90. He tells us, that <hi>actually the Superiors of the Clergy, and of the Religious Orders in</hi> England, <hi>unanimouſly judge the Oath ought not be taken, and publickly profeſs they are of this Judgment.</hi> If he have Commiſſion to ſpeak for thoſe Gentlemen, he would do well to produce it. I have the leſs temptation to believe him on his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he formerly undertook for Proteſtants more than, I believe, they ſtand to, and becauſe he tells us here their profeſſion is publick; which if it were, other people methinks might know it as well as himſelf; and I, for my part, never heard of any ſuch matter. All I can ſay is, that if the Superiors of the Clergy judge as he ſays they do, they degenerate from their Predeceſſors. For the Superior in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> approved and took the Oath, and admoniſhed both Clergy and Laity to follow his Example. And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Remonſtrance was approved by the Superior at that time, which is ſo near the Oath of Allegiance, that I cannot think he would have diſapproved the Oath, if it had been put to him. Of the Superiors of Orders, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I could meet with the publick profeſſion he talks of, I can ſay nothing. Only I think it no impoſſible thing, that they ſhould approve ſomething diſapprov'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it actually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the three Propoſitions. But I think it but reaſonable they ſhould ſpeak for themſelves, and we not be put to learn their ſence from others.</p>
            <p>The following <hi>Section</hi> remains in generals, without applying any thing to the particular caſe. Had he gon about to evince there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubtful in the Oath, which he ſays is ſo eaſie to do, there had been ſomething to anſwer. Now I can only ſay, that people, unleſs they have ſcruples put in their heads, do not uſe to doubt of their own ſtedfaſt Perſwaſions, and thoſe they ſwear in the Oath.</p>
            <p>The 92 <hi>Section</hi> confidently vouches all the Divines and Canoniſts for 500 years, as granted to be on his ſide by his Adverſaries. And this is both diſprov'd before, and manifeſtly falſe, even by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53776:104"/> of our Adverſaries. For the Author of the former Treatiſe builds his whole diſcourſe on this ground, that School-men have been wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about this matter 500 years ago, and may do ſo for ought he knows 500 years hence. And certainly they are not very well agreed who wrangle. Then he goes on deſcanting on his falſe ground, till he comes to ask why <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and thoſe of his ſide, may not as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be thought to have ſeen as far as <hi>Withrington</hi> and his Cabal. Compariſons, they ſay, are odious; and however, his prudent thoughts, I conceive, make little towards Truth or Falſhood. When he ſhews that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the reſt have brought convincing proofs for what they ſay, we ſhall be all of his prudent perſwaſion. In the mean time we muſt beg his permiſſion to think a bad Argument is a bad Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoever makes it, and that the greateſt men have their failings. Nor can we think it prudent, when we ſee thoſe great men, once in their lives, are out of the ſtory, for their ſakes to take wrong for right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 93. He tells us, that <hi>Preſton, as he is informed, never took the Oath, nor perſwaded any man to take it.</hi> What then? no more have twenty others, nor indeed any man, to whom it has not been offered. He himſelf, I fancy, has never refus'd it; though I know not why he ſhould, if he have no better reaſons than he has put into his Treatiſe. What's all this to purpoſe? And for perſwading others, <hi>Preſton</hi> did his endeavor to ſatisfie all men that it might be taken, as he has, that it may not. More perſwaſion than this it is a praiſe to <hi>Preſton</hi> that he uſed not. For who goes about by earneſtneſs and pretended Zeal to work upon people farther than their Judgment leads them, diſcovers more addiction to the thing, than good will to them, and is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of whom they ought beware.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the ſame Author grants the Pope has Authority to order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Temporal Affairs of Princes,</hi> and ſays, <hi>the Controverſie is only concerning Coercive Power.</hi> I miſtake that Author if he do not grant the Pope a Coercive Power too, provided that Coercion be Spiritual. But this, he ſays, is contrary to the Article of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> which denys the Pope has any Authority over the Temporals of Princes. As if the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> or any body in his wits, ever dreamt of denying the Pope might command a ſinner, though a Prince, to abſtain from Wine, or Women, or reſtore Goods unjuſtly gotten, or relieve the extreme Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his Neighbor with Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every Ghoſtly Father has ſuch power over his Penitent. Can any man fancy it ever came into
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53776:105"/> the head of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> that the Pope could not do as much as a Ghoſtly Father? Now Wine, and Women, and Money being plainly Temporal things, 'tis plain the Authority of the Pope extends to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, and that not only by way of Direction, but Coercion too. For the ſinner who refuſes to obey his Directions, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to Sathan by him, and with Spiritual Puniſhments forc'd into repentance. So much, I think, no Catholick denys.</p>
            <p>Apply this now to our caſe, and ſtating it with all the advantage that can be to the Pope, the utmoſt which I apprehend can be ſaid, is, That he may Judge a Prince abuſes his Temporal Government to the ruin of his own Soul, and hazard of many others: and in care of thoſe Souls command him to alter, or leave off his Government, which is incompatible with his Salvation: and in caſe of refuſal, draw his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sword, and uſe it againſt him. The Pope when he judges thus, may be in the right, and he may be in the wrong. If he be in the right, the Prince who refuſes to obey him, hazards or ruins his Soul; for which he is to anſwer to Almighty God, from whoſe Juſtice no worldly greatneſs can free any man. But he is accountable to no body elſe, according to the Doctrin of the beſt Maſters of Chriſtianity. Nor can the Pope take his Kingdom, or any Temporal thing elſe from him againſt his will, no more than he can break open the Cellers, or Houſes of the ſinners before mentioned, and break their Veſſels, and let out their Wine, and carry away their Money, unleſs in vertue of his Temporal Authority where he has it; or than the Ghoſtly Father, who enjoyns his Penitent a Diſcipline which he will not take, can himſelf whip him by force. If the Pope be in the wrong, all he does is <hi>Clave errante,</hi> and he is to anſwer to God for his miſtaking proceedings; and the Prince does well to refuſe his Directions, and ſtand out his Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. Whether of the two be in the right, is all one to Subjects. For they are ſtill to ſtand by their Prince, who whether vertuous or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is ſtill their Prince, and by the Law of God ſtill to be obey'd in matters belonging to Civil Government. How right ſoever the Pope may otherwiſe judge, when he would alter the frame of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and diſturb the publick Peace, and diſpoſſeſs their King by force, there they are ſure he is in the wrong, and may, and muſt ſtand even by a vicious Prince againſt him, and cannot anſwer it to God and a good Conſcience if they do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>This, I think, is the Authority which <hi>Withrington</hi> and his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates grant the Pope over the Temporals even of Princes; which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53776:105"/> what ſervice it will do this Gentleman, we muſt expect to ſee. He tells us, <hi>Sect. 94. They will allow the Pope no more than may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be deduced out of Scripture.</hi> This is a cloſe bob, as if they thought the Scripture alone, to be the Rule of Faith, when yet he knows they do not. Indeed they expect from him, who will have what is attributed to the Pope, paſs for Faith, that he ſhould prove it from Scripture, or Tradition; or ſome way by which Faith may be proved. Otherwiſe they are not ſo ſevere, and will be content with any proof, which is indeed a proof. But to let paſs this gentle touch,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Pope,</hi> ſays he, <hi>may juſtly in ſome caſes, and in order to the Spiritual good of a Nation, command a King to deſiſt from perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Subjects upon the ſcore of Religion, or otherwiſe lay down his Government.</hi> What this caution of <hi>ſome caſes</hi> ſerves for, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gueſs; while he ſpeaks but of one caſe, that of Perſecution. In this caſe, I will allow the Pope may command a King, and that juſtly, to deſiſt from perſecution, and if there be no other means to ſave his Soul, to lay down the Government too. All that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is, that the King who refuſes to obey, ſins againſt God and his own Soul, and ſhall one day account to the ſevere Juſtice of God for it. So I may very juſtly command my Son, who ſpends his Life in debauches, to deſiſt from his debauches, and paſs over his Eſtate, if he cannot abſtain from abuſing it to his own perdition, to his Brother. And I may diſinherit him, if it lye in my power. But if the Eſtate be ſetled on him, I cannot take it away, neither can I knock him on the Head, but muſt endure the miſchief, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remedy, as well as I can; and leave my unreclaimable Son to God and the Laws of the Land. No more can our Spiritual Father the Pope, take any Temporal Eſtate away from an offending Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Child, unleſs it be held by a Temporal Tenure of the Pope; but muſt content himſelf with the ſatisfaction of having done all in his power to reclaim him, and leave the reſt to God's Providence and Juſtice. What will come of this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if,</hi> ſays this Gentleman next, the Pope juſtly may <hi>prohibite his Subjects, in caſe he goes on in perſecuting them upon that account, to bear him civil Allegiance:</hi> This by his favour the Pope may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do in no caſe. He may juſtly, and laudably uſe all the power God has given him, to cauſe a perſecuting Prince to deſiſt from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. But God has given him no power to forbid that Princes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53776:106"/> Subjects from paying him what is his due. Subjects have nothing to do with the Conſcience of their Prince, nor does it any way import them, whether the Pope be in the right when he commands their King, or the King when he refuſes to obey. Till he quit his Throne, whether he do well or ill to keep it, he is ſtill their King: and if the Pope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to bear him civil Allegiance, he forbids what is manifeſtly commanded by the Law of God: nor can they obey him without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying God. What if they be perſecuted? That is no ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty among Chriſtians, that people ſhould be to ſeek what is their duty, when the caſe happens. We have the inſtructions of our Divine Maſter, not to forbear Civil Allegiance, but, to rejoyce and exult, and remember the plentiful reward prepar'd for thoſe who ſuffer perſecution for Juſtice. We have the example of our Holy Anceſtors, who when they were commanded to ſtand to their Arms, to fight againſt this or that Nation, obey'd; when to worſhip, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Incenſe to Idols, preferred God before Man. The harm of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is truly to the perſecutors; the perſecuted are in a bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and aſſured they are ſo by the Oracle of Infallible Truth. If any thing turn them out of this way, and make them forfeit their great hopes, by refuſing to obey God in Man, and poſſeſs their Souls in patience, that, and not perſecution does them harm. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that the Pope may forbid Subjects to bear civil Allegiance, becauſe he may forbid Kings to perſecute, is what I can by no means allow, and what I wonder to ſee aſſumed.</p>
            <p>And yet I wonder more at his concluſion. <hi>How then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>can they ſwear that notwithſtanding any ſentence made or granted, or to be made and granted, by the Pope or his Authority, againſt their Prince, they will bear him true Allegiance?</hi> This in a Catholick, the firſt I think that ever excepted againſt this branch of the Oath, I ſee not only with wonder, but with extreme grief. Will he have it thought the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of Catholicks depends on ſentences made or to be made by the Pope, and that they cannot ſwear the contrary? This clauſe ſays no more than what the moſt ſcrupulous voluntarily offer; no more than what himſelf offers in this very Treatiſe. For one branch of his Form profeſſed to bear true Allegiance to the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him againſt all attempts by any perſon whatſoever, under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pretence. This I take to ſignifie, <hi>notwithſtanding any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence made, or to be made.</hi> I will hope he meant to ſpeak, not to the thing, but to his Adverſaries; not to deny the clauſe might be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53776:106"/> ſworn, but to ſhew it could not be ſworn by them according to their Principles. And this may be ſome excuſe for him, but none for what he ſays. For if that Clauſe be inconſiſtent with the Principles even of the Defenders of the Oath, 'tis much more with thoſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners; ſince theſe allow the Pope more Authority over the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Princes than the other; and would ſtretch that Authority to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing their Subjects againſt them, which the other plainly deny. Catholicks by this account, would be at a fine paſs with his Zeal for their ſatisfaction, unable either of one ſide or the other, to ſwear more Allegiance than pleaſes the Pope. As to the thing it ſelf I have ſpoken already, and declared that Subjects are unconcern'd in the conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pope and their Soveraigns, and obliged by the Law of God to ſtand by them, and defend the publick peace and ſafety, whatever the quarrel be on which they fell out.</p>
            <p>The 95 <hi>Sect.</hi> tells us, <hi>That</hi> Bellarmin <hi>affirms no more of the Popes Power than the Author of the Queſtions ſeems to grant.</hi> Why then the Author of the Queſtions was in the wrong as well as <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and there is an end of the ſtory. But yet they ſeem not to me to ſay altogether the ſame. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> if I be rightly inform'd, puts a ſtanding Power in the Pope, deriv'd from Chriſt, and included in his Univerſal Paſtorſhip, to Depoſe Princes as often as he judges the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Church requires it, and acting by the Authority of a Superior over an Inferior. The <hi>Author</hi> gives the Pope no more Power to Depoſe Princes, than Princes to Depoſe Popes, or any man to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either. In ſhort, he would have it lawful for any man to do any good which he can do, and which is abſolutely neceſſary to be don. The Power by which they act in ſuch caſes is, according to him, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally Power, importing no Authority, or Superiority, but only ſtrength and reaſon to uſe it; ſuch a power as I have over my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours life, over which I have and can ſwear I have no power. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what this <hi>Author</hi> ſays be true or no, which is another Queſtion, 'tis plain enough, that 'tis not the ſame which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays And though it ſhould excuſe a Pope, when in vertue of it he Depoſes a Prince, (which if it do, it will alſo excuſe a Prince, or any man elſe who Depoſes a Pope;) yet it concerns not Subjects. They are ſtill to defend their Prince to the uttermoſt of their power; let the neceſſity be what it will, which ſets the Pope againſt him.</p>
            <p>To make way for ſome Arguments, by confuting of which he means to ſhew the weakneſs of his Adverſaries, the 96 <hi>Sect.</hi> aſſumes,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53776:107"/> That <hi>when the ground, whereon an Author proceeds, is manifeſtly falſe or inconcluſive, no account is to be made of the Opinion or Judgment of ſuch an Author.</hi> In this I think he is much in the right; though I ſuſpect it will hardly pleaſe your Extrinſick-probability-men. For Extrinſick probability, if I miſtake it not, conſiſts in the number and reputation of Authors, as Intrinſick Probability in the weight of Reaſons. If we muſt no longer value Names, but look after Arguments, I doubt it will go hard with Extrinſick Probability, and the Muſter Roles of great Names be much ſhortned. But let what will come of it, as long as what he ſays is true, I cannot but be for him. Now this Plea of his, denys not what is alledged in the Objection, that there are many of Learning and Conſcience who defend the lawfulneſs of the Oath, but contends the allegation is frivolous. And truly I never lookt upon it as otherwiſe valuable, than for the ſatisfaction of thoſe, who will not be content without Crutches, even though their own Legs be ſound. I am very glad he will have it try'd out by the Merits of the Cauſe, which I think much the better, and indeed only efficacious method.</p>
            <p>From hence he takes his riſe to examin the Arguments of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Oath. But this pains, I think, might have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe it belongs not to the Defenders to make Arguments. That task belongs to the Impugners; whoſe Arguments if the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders can ſhew to be inconcluſive, it imports not what they are which they make themſelves, nor whether they make any or no. Kings were Kings, before there were Popes. They had right to the Allegiance of their Subjects from the Law of Nature and Reaſon, before Chriſt came into the World. When he came, he confirm'd that right by his Law, and thoſe who obey'd his Law by their practiſe; till in after Ages pretences were made, in behalf of the Pope, to control that right in certain emergencies. Theſe pretences muſt be proved, if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould paſs: nor have thoſe who deny them, any more to do, than to ſhew they are not proved. The right of Kings needs no more proof, than my right to my Eſtate, in which the Law will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me, till he who claims it, can make out a good Title. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Gentlemans labor in this particular is all uſeleſs; The Pope being never the better, if thoſe who ſpeak for Kings diſcourſe weakly, unleſs they diſcourſe convincingly who ſpeak for him: and it being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe whether their Arguments be good, who do more than they need if they argue at all. Notwithſtanding let us ſee what he ſays.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:53776:107"/>
            <p>For the common reaſon, and ground of his Adverſaries, the 97. <hi>Sect.</hi> puts this poſition: <hi>That a meer Spiritual Power, ſuch as is only granted the Pope over all Chriſtendom, in no caſe poſſible, does extend it ſelf to any Temporal thing.</hi> As common as he makes this reaſon, I ſuſpect there are very few among his Adverſaries who ſay it: neither is it true, when it is ſaid. That Temporal puniſhments cannot be inflicted by a meer Spiritual power; by force, and againſt the will of him who is puniſhed, ſome of them do ſay, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove: but that Spiritual power, does not at all extend it ſelf to Temporals, ſhould be put for their ground; whom before, and in the very next <hi>Sect.</hi> he acknowledges to confeſs the contrary, is a little ſurpriſing. I think it ſuperfluous and tedious to ſpeak again of this matter, of which I have ſo lately declared my ſence, and ſo have only to obſerve what will come of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Reaſon,</hi> he ſays, <hi>does not ſhew that the Pope, as Temporal Prince of</hi> Rome, <hi>has not an Indirect Right and Power to depoſe Kings in ſome caſes, ſuch a Power being inherent to every Soveraign Prince.</hi> He is in the right. This reaſon if he will call it ſo, indeed ſhews no ſuch thing, and 'twere ſtrange it ſhould, and the Pope's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power, or any Right belonging to it, be ſhockt by a reaſon which meddles only with the Spiritual. Neither does he deal very kindly with his Adverſaries, to make them ſuſpected of diſcourſing ſo extravagantly.</p>
            <p>But whatever that Reaſon do, it has been already ſhown that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Princes have no inherent right, or power over one another (meaning by thoſe words what is ordinarily, and the Oath meant by them) though every body knows they can make War, upon, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs one another when they are ſtrong enough. Wherefore, the Pope may keep his Temporal power, and do with it all that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power can do; for any thing his Adverſaries, or the Oath have to do with it. Which being a point ſufficiently diſcourſt already, I ſee no reaſon to diſcourſe it over again.</p>
            <p>In the following <hi>Sections</hi> he ſets himſelf to prove, <hi>that meer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power may in ſome caſes extend it ſelf to Temporal things;</hi> I know not to what purpoſe, when he ſays his Adverſaries confeſs it. They are not like to be in favour with him in haſt, if ſaying juſt what he would have them, will not content him. More words about a point agreed on both ſides, ſeems little better than chat; and yet the croſneſs of his Diſcourſe will keep me a little longer than needs.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53776:108"/> I cannot but wonder to ſee, always in the ſame period, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles either had not, or at leaſt did not exerciſe Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power while they lived, and did uſe Temporall both of them: Chriſt againſt the buyers and ſellers, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> againſt <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> For their Death too, I think he makes an effect of Temporal power. Again, that Excommunication takes away all civil Communication, though due by the Law of Nature. I cannot tell whether <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> be well coupled, but 'tis the firſt time I have heard that bare Excommunication, abſtracting from the Temporal Laws, deprives a Man of any thing due by the Law of Nature, or even of the Land. A Servant muſt pay him the ſervice he ows, a Child the duty, a Debtor the debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only Spiritual goods, the Sacraments and the like are taken away, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpended, till Repentance. And thoſe who need not keep him company, unleſs they pleaſe, are admoniſht to abſtain from it, for his ſake and their own; to preſerve themſelves from the infection of his wickedneſs, and reclaim him by ſhame. What beſides follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Excommunication, is I think refunded into Temporal Laws and Temporal power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Confeſſiarius</hi> whom he brings in <hi>Sect.</hi> 99. is one of whom his Adverſaries make uſe to declare their ſence of Spiritual power, <hi>viz.</hi> that it extends it ſelf to directing and enjoyning that Temporals be uſed according to the Law of God, and puniſhing the obſtinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſer by withholding Spiritual goods. Farther than, which 'tis plain, the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> cannot go, nor as they conceive, the Popes. And this Gentleman ſays nothing to the contrary. Neither does he ſhow what Service the Wife will do him, who cannot live with her Husband without eminent danger of Perdition. She is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly free by the expreſs Law of God, and by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which endures no tye abſolutely inconſiſtent with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and only good. But yet, if ſhe will ſtay, and damn her ſelf he does not go about to ſhew that the Spiritual Power can take her away.</p>
            <p>The 100. <hi>Sect.</hi> tells us, <hi>That more Spiritual Crimes are puniſht with Temporal puniſhments in all Nations.</hi> Thoſe Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being plainly inflicted by Temporal Authority, is it poſſible that any thing ſhould follow to the advantage of the Spiritual? And yet he concludes without more adoe, <hi>That Proteſtants doubtleſs are not of opinion, that one cannot be Temporally puniſht, by a meer
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53776:108"/> Spiritual Power, or upon a meer Spiritual account.</hi> Why but his caſe is of Spiritual crimes puniſht by Temporal Authority. Will he perſwade us Proteſtants are of opinion that who is puniſht by the Temporal, is puniſht by meer Spiritual Power, and that there is no doubt to be made of it? Whatever he fancy of them, I muſt beg his good leave to believe, that Proteſtants are no ſuch irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional people, and that neither they, nor any Man in his Wits can harbour an opinion ſo extravagant. Something I ſuppoſe he means by his, <hi>or upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> meer Spiritual account,</hi> but what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell. Spiritual Power, and Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itual Accounts, are plainly different things, which methinks it is not fair to tumble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let the account on which the Temporal power is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, be what it will, if it be Temporal Power which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, I ſee not what meer Spiritual Power, of which he is talking, has to do in the caſe.</p>
            <p>Neither perhaps is ſo much true, that the Temporal Power, when it puniſhes what he calls meerly Spiritual crimes, proceeds on a meer Spiritual Account. <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtacy,</hi> in which he inſtances, ſeldom become Univerſal without diſturbance of the publick peace, the preſervation of which plainly belongs to the care of the Temporal Power, on a Temporal account. <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> his third inſtance, as plainly takes away the reſpect due to God, and with it the Aw of Divine Juſtice; and concern for the next Life. Who thinks the Temporal Power unconcern'd in ſuch things, had not reflected what ill living there would be, in a Common-wealth, where no Man's Oath, and much leſs his Word would be truſted. And manifeſtly there is no truſt to be given to his Oath, who has no fear of God; and yet without Truſt, civil Society, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, cannot be maintained. Generally, who conſiders that fear of Temporal puniſhments alone, is an unſafe, and no laſting ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Government (for thoſe who have no other check will break the Laws as often as they can hope by Favour, or Power, or Artifice to ſcape thoſe puniſhments) and that it is a great deal more eaſie, and more ſecure where people obey for Conſcience, will find that, without relation to Spiritual accounts, the care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick quiet, and ſafety, makes Governours concerned in the vertue of their Subjects, bad Men ſeldom proving good Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
            <p>The next Conſideration is ſo croſly entangled, that I hardly know
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53776:109"/> how to unravel it. He objects againſt himſelf, that <hi>Temporal Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> enact ſuch Laws againſt Spiritual Crimes as prejudicial to the Temporal good of their Subjects, or as impowred by ſeveral Titles allow'd them to defend the Church,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt of theſe is what I come from ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; what he means by the ſecond, his <hi>ſeveral Titles,</hi> and by whom he would have them allow'd I cannot gueſs, nor imagin what other Title there needs to provide againſt prejudice to the Temporal good of their Subjects, more than the Temporal power with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted. But whatever he means, he would have it follow, that <hi>The Pope may deprive one of ſome Temporal thing (if nothing elſe do hinder it) when it is prejudicial to the Spiritual good of Chriſtians: For he is inveſted alſo with ſeveral Titles, which enable him to direct the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Princes in order to their or their Subjects Spiritual, good.</hi> How many Titles he has I know not, and while one will ſerve turn, care not to inquire. By his Title of Univerſal Paſtor, I conceive, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred to direct the Temporals, even of Princes, to their Spiritual good; but I do not know that he is impowred by that Title, or any elſe to deprive them of their Temporals againſt their wills. To put <hi>Direction</hi> in the premiſes, and <hi>Deprivation</hi> in the concluſion is foul play.</p>
            <p>But he goes on: <hi>Becauſe if a meer Temporal power can extend it ſelf to the Temporal puniſhment of a meer Spiritual Crime (when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Temporal good, the Judgment of which Crime does not belong to the Temporal Court) why may not a meer Spiritual power enjoyn in certain caſes (if there be not ſome other obſtacle) a Temporal puniſhment, or deprive of ſome Temporal thing, in order to a Spiritual end? The Execution of which puniſhment, and the Deprivation of which thing, belongs to the Temporal Prince.</hi> I, for my part, deſpair to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle how that Crime ſhould be meerly Spiritual, which is prejudicial to the Temporal good: and how the Temporal Court can be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the cognizance of things prejudicial to Temporals. As alſo how a meer Spiritual power deprives one of a Temporal thing, when that deprivation is to be made, not by the Spiritual, but Temporal power. And more than all, how it will follow, that becauſe a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power can puniſh with a Temporal puniſhment, a Spiritual power can puniſh with a Temporal puniſhment too. I ſhould have thought the direct contrary had follow'd, That as the Temporal power can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh even a Spiritual Crime with no other than a Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo the Spiritual can puniſh no crime with any other puniſhment than a Spiritual.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:53776:109"/>
            <p>The Caſe it ſelf is plain enough if we could let it alone. Every body knows the ſame offence may, and moſt times does concern the care of both Powers: The Spiritual, as a breach of the Law of God; the Temporal, as harmful to the Common-wealth. Both may take cognizance of it, both proceed to ſentence, and execution of that ſentence, actual puniſhment. But then as the Powers are different, ſo are the Puniſhments: The Spiritual importing leſs, or ſuſpenſion of Spiritual goods, and the Temporal of Temporal. This, I think, is in two intelligible words the whole buſineſs, and this his Adverſaries not only grant but endeavor to prove. He may make his beſt on't when he thinks fit. In the mean time I ſee not what ſervice the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Temporal power againſt what he calls meer Spiritual Crimes will do to the Spiritual power. And I doubt beſides, his Zeal, and the heat of Argument has tranſported him a little beyond the bounds he had preſcrib'd himſelf. He profeſſes only to anſwer his Adverſaries Arguments againſt depoſition, but by no means to aſſert it himſelf; and yet makes an Argument, which, if it were true, would infer Depoſition. For if meer Spiritual power can extend it ſelf to the deprivation of Temporals, there will be no reaſon ſtrong enough to confine it to this or that private caſe, and hinder it from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this deprivation even to Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>To leave no ſtone unturn'd, <hi>Sect.</hi> 102. he trys what the Spiritual power will do, and what the Temporal again, but acting now not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things but perſons. Of the former he ſays, ſince <hi>the power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (which is meerly Spiritual) may puniſh meer Civil Crimes, why may not therefore, in like manner, a meer Spiritual power inflict Temporal puniſhment?</hi> This Queſtion ſeems to anſwer it ſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> For Excommunication being a Spiritual puniſhment, and the power to inflict it Spiritual power: This is to ask in other terms, why a power to inflict Spiritual cannot inflict Temporal puniſhment? To which a body would think there needs no other Anſwer than the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it ſelf. Beſides, I mightily ſuſpect whether there be any meer Civil Crimes for Excommunication to puniſh, and if there be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meer Spiritual power have any thing to do with them. And yet if both were true, puniſhing a Civil Crime with a <hi>Spiritual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is one thing, puniſhing the ſame Crime with a <hi>Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> another; and theſe two things are ſo unlike, that I wonder what <hi>like manner</hi> he could fancy to infer one from the other.</p>
            <p>Of the ſecond he ſays, ſince <hi>a meer Temporal power may puniſh Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53776:110"/> Princes, why may not a meer Spiritual power puniſh Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral perſons.</hi> Truly I expected not he ſhould ſubject Eccleſiaſtical Princes to the puniſhment of meer Temporal power in any caſe. To be as condeſcending as he, I will allow, that meer Spiritual power may puniſh Temporal perſons: but when he adds, <hi>and with Temporal puniſhments,</hi> I muſt intreat him to excuſe me, that addition being violently thruſt in, without any pretence which can handſomely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce it. Yet he does all he can, and is content, ſo he can but get it in, that it come in company of the Civil Magiſtrate. Now, I conceive, that what the Civil Magiſtrate does, is don by Civil Power. 'tis true, the Spiritual Magiſtrate may ſollicit the Civil to uſe his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power; but 'tis plainly the Civil Power which is uſed by him, nor does the effect follow from Spiritual Power, but from him who has it; and who has it not may ſollicit the Civil Magiſtrate, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect as well as he. So that meer Spiritual Power does nothing at all in that caſe, how much ſoever he does who had it. And all the deſire he has ſhewn, and all the diligence he has uſed, to enable the Spiritual Power to inflict Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſerves but to ſhew that Falſe will not be True for any mans ſake.</p>
            <p>The 103 <hi>Section</hi> tells us, <hi>the ſtouteſt maintainers of the Oath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but a Subject perſecuted for Religion, and in imminent danger of perſwaſion may lawfully fly into a Foreign Country, according to the Goſpel, Cum perſecuti vos fuerint in una Civitate fugite in aliam.</hi> The maintainers of the Oath indeed are not ſo ſtout, as to deny an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command of the Goſpel, nor ſo irrational as to affirm, that what they ſee don every day for profit, and Temporal advantages, may not be don when it is neceſſary to Salvation. What then? <hi>His Spiritual directors may counſel, or enjoyn him to fly.</hi> Very true, for the Law of God counſels and enjoyns this before. <hi>And conſequently ſuch a man deprives his Prince, on a meer Spiritual account, of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural born Subject, which belongs to the Temporalties of the Prince.</hi> The Prince is indeed deprived of a Subject, when that Subject, who has the warrant of Gods Law for flying, will make uſe of the liberty he has. But what is this to the Spiritual Power? can the Spiritual Power ſpirit him away, if he will not go? or exempt him from the duty of a Subject, while he remains under the government of his Prince? If the Spiritual Power can do neither of theſe, I ſee not what pretence ſhe can have to inflict Temporal puniſhments, from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53776:110"/> the liberty, and obligation a man has to obey the Law of God. It is alſo true, that Catholicks, perſwaded that the command of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God before Man, has place in their caſe, do venture to tranſgreſs ſeveral Laws of the Nation. But till he ſhew how it is to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; an inſtance in which there is neither Spiritual, nor any Power Temporal, nor any Puniſhment, ſeems far enough from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Spiritual Power can puniſh with Temporal Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>The 140 <hi>Section</hi> ſums up the particulars, which his Inſtances, he ſays, evince. That <hi>Spiritual and Temporal things are not ſo vaſtly different that they cannot Interfare.</hi> This is the firſt News we have heard of <hi>Interfaring;</hi> of which, if he will have my Opinion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they are rather Spiritual and Temporal Perſons, than Things, or Powers which Interfare. God who is the Author of both Powers never made them inconſiſtent. Wherefore when any Interfaring hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, I think there is ſome fault, of one ſide or other, in the men who have the Powers; into which the Interfaring is to be refunded, not into any oppoſition in the nature of the Things. That <hi>it is not always unlawful to deprive one of a Temporal thing, on a meer Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual account.</hi> This indeed has been ſaid before, but will not make to his purpoſe, though it be ſaid over never ſo often. Whether that Temporal thing can be taken away by a meer Spiritual Power, is the queſtion; what the account is, on which it is taken away, imports not. And the Spiritual Power has plainly nothing to do in the caſe, if it be the Temporal, which takes it away, though on a Spiritual account. That <hi>a meer Spiritual Power may in ſome caſes extend it ſelf to Temporal things.</hi> This being agreed before he began; why his Inſtances ſhould be troubled about it, I cannot imagine. He knows, and confeſſes, the ſtout maintainers of the Oath are complaiſant enough in this point. Where Temporals are abuſed contrary to the Law of God, They ſay the Spiritual Power may direct, and enjoyn them to be uſed according to his Law, and puniſh the Tranſgreſſors with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments proper to that power; which is to ſay, that Spiritual Power does extend it ſelf to Temporals. And ſure there needs no rack of Arguments to make them confeſs, what they voluntarily avow. And conſequently, that <hi>This (Viz.</hi> That Spiritual Power can in no caſe poſſible extend it ſelf to Temporals) <hi>is no proof, that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Depoſe.</hi> He may pleaſe to tell them ſo, who ſay it is. The Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the Oath, who ſay it is not true, are far enough from making a proof on't.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:53776:111"/>
            <p>And ſo we are at an end of the firſt Objection; which I ſuſpect will afford his Adverſaries more cauſe of complaint, than ſatisfaction, or trouble to anſwer. If any one among them have made ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the reſt have no reaſon to complain, if he and his Argument be bafled as much as this Gentleman pleaſes. But it ſeems not fair to obtrude upon them as the common reaſon of moſt of theſe Authors, what peradventure no one of them admits, and whereof he himſelf ſays they hold the contrary. Their Reaſons and Arguments are no ſecrets. They may eaſily be taken, and how much ſoever they be confuted, cannot be diſowned by the Authors. Theſe which he makes for them to his knowledge they do diſown, and to take pains to confute them, is little better than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conſult how he ſhall be puniſht who never committed the Fact. How well ſoever he can anſwer it them, for making them ſay what they do not ſay, I think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces little to his principal Deſign, the ſatisfaction of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. For ſure they will not receive much ſatisfaction by ſeeing a great deal of time ſpent in diſproving what peradventure no body holds.</p>
            <p>The next Objection, <hi>Sect.</hi> 105. is a chip of the ſame block. He would have it common among his Advetſaries to infer, that becauſe depoſing Doctrine, or the unlawfulneſs of the Oath, is no Article of Faith, therefore one may lawfully take it. Such Arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming only thoſe who wear Fools Coats; he is a little too ſevere to pin them on his Adverſaries. That the depoſing Doctrine is no point of Faith; indeed they ſay, and they ſay alſo, that the Oath might be taken; but neither they nor any Man in his Wits, ever went about to infer one from t'other.</p>
            <p>The 106. <hi>Sect.</hi> tells us what we know already, <hi>That the defenders of depoſing Doctrine do not unanimouſly affirm, it is an Article of Faith.</hi> Truly 'tis bad enough that they do not unanimouſly affirm the contrary, and that thoſe who do affirm it, ſhould pretend to be Maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not know ſo much as what their Faith is. <hi>But ſome endeavour to prove it from Scripture as a meer Theological Truth; others from Preſcription; others from Donation, or Agreement betwixt Catholick Princes.</hi> I thought they would not have gone leſs, then the Univerſal Paſtor, and direct Commiſſion from Chriſt. For thoſe have been the Pleas perpetually inſiſted on in this ſuit. Now it ſeems they will be content to drive the nail that will go, and yield to any terms ſo they gain the point. It is ſome comfort yet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53776:111"/> that they themſelves think not fit to truſt the former Topicks, when they fly to new ones, and ſuch as are the moſt unlikely in the World to do them ſervice. For there is little hope in <hi>Preſcription</hi> where the point has always been conteſted, as this confeſſedly has, and that Princes ſhould voluntarily give, or agree away their Rights, is yet more deſperate. He ſays the famous conſtitution of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lateran</hi> is alledged to this purpoſe; which is news to me. I think it is uſually alledged to exalt the depoſing Doctrine into Faith: to which purpoſe it is alledged by the Author of the firſt Treatiſe. If he think the back of the knife ſharper than the edge, he may uſe it as he pleaſes. But in all appearance 'twil cut no better. That aſſent of the Ambaſſadors of Princes, which he mentions, ſeems to me a ſtrong proof, that the Princes that ſent them were not concern'd in the Decree. For they were ſtrange Ambaſſadors, if they aſſented to a Decree prejudicial to their Maſters, without Commiſſion; and they were ſtranger Princes, if they gave Commiſſion to prejudice their own Rights. And though theſe ſtrange things could be ſuppoſed, it yet remains to be conſidered whether ſuch Commiſſions could validly be granted by thoſe Princes, without the privity and conſent of their Kingdoms, they having ſo much intereſt in the buſineſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his unexpected allegation is a ſtrong inducement to perſwade one, that Soveraign Princes, as they are not expreſt, ſo were never meant in the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is not impoſſible, ſays he, <hi>Sect.</hi> 107. that Catholick Princes ſhould make a League to attack him among them who ſhould turn Heretick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what then? <hi>It is not impoſſible,</hi> therefore <hi>it is,</hi> is no better than <hi>'Tis not Faith,</hi> therefore <hi>'tis not true,</hi> as he would make his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries argue. Tell us not what may be, but what is, if you will ſpeak to purpoſe. And yet it were at leaſt ſomething, if theſe May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be's were a jot ſerviceable. But he tells us, that though ſuch a League were made, and the Pope ſhould declare upon it, and a Prince be depoſed, this Prince would not be depoſed in force of the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, but of the Contract. Which is to ſay, that the Pope and the Oath have nothing to do with his not-impoſſible Caſe. And ſure he might have ſpent his and our time more profitably, than to amuſe us with ſuch things which never were, and never will be, and which though they were, all would be juſt as if they were not. He concludes at laſt in the following <hi>Section,</hi> that <hi>the fore-mentioned Reaſon is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53776:112"/> falſe.</hi> Very right. And it is alſo manifeſtly falſe that any body ever took it for a Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And ſo he paſſes to what he calls another main Argument, and of which, he ſays, the Defenders of the Oath make great account. This <hi>Section</hi> 109 he propoſes in this manner: <hi>That our Saviour came not into the World to deprive other men of their Temporal Dominions, much leſs Kings of their Kingdoms.</hi> For which he cries out of the Goſpel, <hi>Regnum meum non eſt de hoc mundo,</hi> and out of a Hymn of the Church, <hi>Non eripit mortalia qui regna dat caeleſtia. Hence,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they infer that the Pope has no power, for his power muſt be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately deriv'd from Chriſt, whoſe Vicar he is.</hi> They do indeed make great account of the Goſpel, and the Church; but I do not think they make any account of this Argument, or ever made it. They argue not from the end for which Chriſt came, but from the Power he thought fit to aſſume himſelf, and leave in the World after him to compaſs that end. This Power they have learnt from him, and the Church, is not of this World, or ſuch by which the things of this World are taken away; and this Power they deny the Pope, becauſe Chriſt deni'd it of himſelf. Their Inference then is this; Chriſt had no ſuch Power, therefore neither has the Pope. Chriſt came not to take away Kingdoms, therefore neither has the Pope cannot, or Chriſt could not, is an Inference of his own making, and he may do what he will with his own, ſave putting it on his Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Three things he has to ſay on this Subject. 1. <hi>That the Authority of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, did in ſome caſes extend it ſelf to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Temporals.</hi> Which, he ſays, has been proved. I wiſh he had ſaid where. For as my memory is bad, I remember nothing but our Savior's caſting the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and the deaths of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> which were formerly mentioned to ſhew that Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſed a Temporal Power, which, in the ſame place, he ſays, they did not uſe. If theſe paſſages be the proof he means, I muſt, before I can anſwer it, expect to ſee which way he will go about to contrive them into a proof. For of themſelves they ſeem far enough from it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt caſe there was no deprivation of Temporals, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. The Money and Victims were not taken away, only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of a holy place was hindred, and that miraculouſly. This, in the opinion of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> being the greateſt of Chriſts Miracles.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53776:112"/> In the deaths of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> I ſee not what ſhare the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had, more than a prophetical denouncing of a Judgment of God ready to fall upon their Avarice. Otherwiſe he did not cut their throats, or offer them any violence. Now 'tis paſt my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how Miracles, and no-deprivation, ſhould do this Gentleman ſervice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this conſequence, <hi>Chriſt had no ſuch Power,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Pope has it not,</hi> is null, becauſe ſince Chriſts time, the Pope is become a Temporal Prince. Very true: but this conſequence is good, <hi>Chriſt had no ſuch Power,</hi> therefore <hi>the Pope has it not purely from Chriſt,</hi> which is all the conſequence his Adverſaries make. And ſo much he himſelf grants, by acknowledging this Temporal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty was granted by Temporal Princes, or otherwiſe acquired. And for the reſt, I have often declared that the Oath meddles not with the Temporal Power either of the Pope, or any other Prince.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Scripture and Hymn cited, do not prove, that <hi>our Saviour had no Authority in ſome extraordinary caſe, to deprive Kings of their Dominions.</hi> The Butter, it ſeems would not hold out to the Bread, it is ſo thin ſpread. Otherwiſe it needed not to have been made one Head, that <hi>'tis manifeſtly falſe,</hi> and another, that <hi>'tis not proved.</hi> Proofs are ſuperfluous where things are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. Neither did any Man, that I know, ever deny that Chriſt had Authority in extraordinary, and ordinary, and all caſes, to diſpoſe of Kingdoms, and all Nature too, as he pleaſed. He was God, and might do what he would with his Creatures. But ſpeaking of that ordinary power which he thought fit to aſſume as Man, and eſtabliſh in the Church after him, what ails the Scripture and Hymn cited, that they may not paſs for a proof?</p>
            <p>A body would expect this ſhould be ſhewn by what follows; but for ought I perceive, he may expect long enough, and get nothing at laſt. <hi>God,</hi> ſays this Gentleman, <hi>has not given me this life to kill my Neighbour;</hi> yet I may ſometimes unblameable do it. <hi>The King was not made King to take away from other Princes their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet may, if otherwiſe he cannot defend his own.</hi> What then? This is to ſay, one may uſe the power which he has, more ways than one. For who actually kills his Neighbour, has certainly power to kill him; and who diſpoſſeſſes another Prince, power to diſpoſſeſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53776:113"/> him. But, whether Chriſt, in the forementioned reſpects, had power to deprive Kings of their Dominions, or no, is the queſtion; to which nothing is ſaid, by ſaying that if he had it, he might uſe it ſeveral ways. What elſe he adds, is of the ſame ſtrain, altogether wide of the mark, and which I think the Reader will need no more than his own eyes, to ſee is ſo.</p>
            <p>In the 110. <hi>Sect.</hi> he objects againſt himſelf, that the caſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, may be attributed to an extraordinary power in Chriſt and his Apoſtles, not derived by ſucceſſion to the Pope. To this he anſwers, that <hi>all the caſes alledged are not ſuch,</hi> inſtancing in the power of depriving a Man of civil converſation by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſeparating a Husband from his Wife, <hi>inherent in the Pope according to his ordinary Juriſdiction.</hi> This is ſurpriſing, nor can I imagine which way inſtances of ordinary power in the Pope, ſhould prove the inſtances alledged did not proceed from extraordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Chriſt. He is to ſhew there intervened no extraordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his inſtances of the buyers, and ſellers, and <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira;</hi> if he will ſpeak to the purpoſe. No body denies the power of Excommunication was ordinary and deriv'd from Chriſt. The queſtion is, of the power of depoſition. And that I ſhould think will hardly be prov'd to be ordinary, by this, that the power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is ſo.</p>
            <p>He adds that <hi>the forementioned Inſtances do ſhew, that though Chriſt's Power upon Earth was meerly Spiritual, and his Kingdom not of this World, yet he exercis'd ſometimes his powor over Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, which was the main intent</hi> for which they were brought. Truly he needed not have put himſelf to the trouble of bringing any for that intent. For that Spiritual power may be exerciſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Temporals, no body denies. But 'tis deny'd that any inſtance he has, or can bring, proves that the meer Spiritual and ordinary power of Chriſt extended to deprive Kings of their Kingdoms. When he has prov'd this by his inſtances, he will indeed have done his buſineſs, and ſomething more. For he will have proved too, that Chriſts power on Earth was not meerly Spiritual, and that his Kingdom was of this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> he ſays, <hi>that it is a very extraordinary caſe, for Popes to depoſe Kings, and even (which is much leſs) to Excommunicate them.</hi> And the depoſing Men ſay, <hi>the Pope has received that power only for extraordinary caſes.</hi> As if it were to purpoſe what the caſe is, when
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53776:113"/> we are talking of the Power. If the <hi>Power</hi> be ordinary, it is to be feared the <hi>Caſe</hi> may prove but too ordinary one day. For it is no ſuch extraordinary thing for a Prince to do, what ſome of the maintainers of depoſing Doctrine ſay, is a juſt cauſe of depoſition. But letting that paſs, I would only know how this, which he ſays here, makes to his purpoſe. He was to ſhew that there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power in the inſtances by him alledged. Whether the caſes, in which ſome ſay the Pope may depoſe, be this or that, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or extraordinary, to my apprehenſion contributes nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhewing, that the Power of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was not extraordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 111. He cannot but reflect upon</hi> his Adverſaries. Reflections in my opinion, are not ſo very neceſſary towards the ſatisfaction of peoples Conſciences, but that they might be well enough ſpared. Yet 'tis not to be expected, his Adverſaries ſhould ſcape them, if they have deſerv'd them. Let us ſee how rational they are. <hi>They require,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the Kings dethroning Power be ſhewn out of Scripture.</hi> This I have met with, and anſwered before. It is not true that they abſolutely require Scripture proof. They require proof from Scripture, or ſome other Topick, by which Faith may be proved, from thoſe who will have the dethroning power <hi>Faith:</hi> and from thoſe who will have it <hi>True,</hi> they require ſuch a proof as may make it appear <hi>True.</hi> And this I think is rational. But to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon them, that nothing will ſerve their turn but Scripture proof: to traduce them for making Scripture the only rule of Faith: and then cry them down for Hereticks: is not fair play. And I muſt needs think their Conduct more rational than his Reflection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If,</hi> ſays he farther, the depoſing Men <hi>produce out of Scripture ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances to prove that Chriſt and his Apoſtles Power did extend it ſelf ſometimes to Temporals; than they anſwer, that ſuch caſes were extraordinary, and conſequently ought not be brought as proofs of any ſuch power in the Pope.</hi> This is in ſhort, we can make no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which our ill natur'd Adverſaries will not make a ſhift to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; a wonderful rational complaint without doubt. Twiſt your Ropes ſtronger if you will have them hold, or if you cannot, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of your ſelves, and your rotten materials, and not of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Men are ſtubborn now a days, and will not be held by Threads which they can break. Yet he complains on, <hi>That though Chriſt had depoſed never ſo many Kings, the ſame Anſwer,</hi> by flying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53776:114"/> to extraordinary power, <hi>would put them all off.</hi> And this is juſt the Shepherds quarrel, who fell to cuffs whoſe flock ſhould firſt paſs the Bridge, if there had been one, when all the while there was none. Chriſt never depos'd a King in his Life: what have we to do to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether he had acted by an ordinary, or extraordinary power if he had?</p>
            <p>The truth is, all this is empty common place work. That Chriſt was God as well as Man, and had extraordinary and miraculous, as well as ordinary power, and might, and did uſe now the one, now the other, as he pleaſed; this Gentleman with all his reflections will not deny. People may be in the right, and they may be in the wrong, when they attribute effects to either power. But that right and wrong cannot be determined, but by deſcending to particulars. Since it is manifeſt that Chriſt did uſe extraordinary power; it is manifeſt his Adverſaries may have reaſon to attribute an effect to extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power, unleſs he ſhew in particular that it proceeded from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To talk in generals, is to ſhoot at random, make a noiſe, and hit no body, unleſs by chance. The trick of inlarging on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places is ſometimes uſed in Rhetorick, for Amplification; but if it ſtay in the <hi>may be,</hi> and come not to the <hi>Is,</hi> it is inſipid, and and hardly paſſable even there. When people are in ſearch of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning truths, there is no place for it.</p>
            <p>The 112. <hi>Sect.</hi> mentions for another reaſon of his Adverſaries, that, <hi>before the time of</hi> Gregory <hi>VII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was no precedent of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi> I fear this Gentleman, whom I cannot ſuſpect of diſſembling what he thinks makes againſt him, has not himſelf examined matters ſo carefully, as thoſe whom he concludes <hi>deſtitute of all rational motives,</hi> and mov'd to ſtand out only by <hi>Ignorance, and Obſtinacy.</hi> However it happens, no one of their reaſons has hitherto been ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged home. This is the faireſt put of any; For 'tis at leaſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> but yet it is not the <hi>whole Truth.</hi> Want of Precedents is not the only thing alledged. They alledge beſides, that none of the Fathers taught depoſition, and not only ſo, but that many of them taught Doctrine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with it. And they conceive that a Doctrine neither practis'd nor taught, for 10 whole Ages, in which too the contrary was irreprehenſibly taught, cannot be a Doctrine of the Church. For this Topick reaches no farther. Who will notwithſtanding ſtand up for the Truth of it, may do ſo, and be heard, and do wonders, if he can, with his Argument. In the mean time, what has this Gentleman to ſay to the Reaſon objected?</p>

            <p>He ſays, <hi>It is not ſolid. Firſt, becauſe thoſe who ground the</hi> Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Power upon Preſcription or Agreement made between Princes, can eaſily anſwer, that in the time of the Pagan Emperors there was no ſuch Preſcription or Argument made.</hi> And we can as eaſily reply, that there never was any ſince. Till Time, and Place, and Perſons be ſpecifi'd; The Princes named who agreed away their Rights; The Commiſſions and Inſtructions produced, by which their Embaſſadors were impowr'd to paſs them away; The Nations ſhewn, in which the Preſcription had place, and the Agreement was obſerved; in fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till all particulars be proved, which in a matter of this conſequence ought be proved; I doubt the Reaſon will appear more ſolid than the Anſwer. This Preſcription, and Agreement is a Fancy, which I do not remember to have met with any where but in theſe Papers, and which if I had not met with there, I ſhould hardly have believ'd could have entred into a ſober Head. I cannot look upon it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as a twig of a drowning man, and ſo I leave it with a flat denial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe, ſince Depoſition was to be put in execution by the help of ſome Chriſtian Prince, there was not for a long time any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince at all, or any one ſo powerful that could put it in Execution.</hi> This Anſwer is not more ſolid than the other. For there were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes enough, and powerful enough, betwixt <hi>Conſtantin</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, if their help were ſo abſolutely neceſſary. But I ſee not what need there was of them, as long as there were Chriſtian Subjects. For why might not they have ſerv'd turn in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity? Let but Subjects univerſally withdraw their Obedience, and their Prince ſhall be Depos'd, though there be never another, beſides himſelf, in the World. Now if the Pope could abſolve them from their Allegiance, and oblige them to withdraw their Obedience, he might have put his Depoſing Power in practice often enough, and never ſtaid for the help of a Chriſtian Prince. For 'tis plain there were Chriſtian Subjects enough in the World before <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> VII.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>becauſe 'tis no good Argument, ſuch a Power was not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd till ſuch a time, therefore there was no ſuch Power till ſuch a time.</hi> Truly it is not very good, and while he has the making of his Adverſaries Arguments, none ever ſhall, for ought I ſee. I ſuſpect his Adverſaries would hardly take that Concluſion, though he ſhould willingly give it them, and much leſs take pains to ſettle it. For to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53776:115"/> ſay, <hi>There was no ſuch Power till ſuch a time,</hi> is almoſt to ſay, that <hi>at,</hi> or <hi>after ſuch a time there was,</hi> which they are far enough from allowing. But though they would admit the concluſion, I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think, as ignorant as he makes them, they would deduce it from an Antecedent which manifeſtly infers it not. The Exerciſe of a Power may ſeveral ways be ſuperſeded, without prejudice to the Power. The Caſe may not happen, in which it is to be exercis'd: or, if it do, it may be accompanied with Circumſtances which render the exerciſe improper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet, I fancy, the Shop affords good Ware, if people would chuſe it.</p>
            <p>Put for the Antecedent, That <hi>ſuch a Power was neither exercis'd nor taught in the Church, before ſuch a time,</hi> and I conceive it follows, That <hi>ſuch a Power was never taught by Chriſt.</hi> This Conſequence, even bating that the contrary was taught in the Church, whoever will deny, muſt, I fear, be forc't to grant, that the Church was no faithful Depoſitary of the Doctrin delivered to her by Chriſt. For if ſhe did preſerve the ſacred <hi>Depoſitum</hi> intire, and Depoſing Doctrin were not found in her ſtore-houſe, 'tis manifeſt that Depoſing was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put into it.</p>
            <p>Again, Suppoſe his Adverſaries ſhould deſire to know of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whether in thoſe times in which they neither exercis'd, nor taught any ſuch Power, he thinks they knew of any ſuch Power? If he thinks they did, it will be expected he ſhould declare what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives he has to think ſo, and from whence he can gather that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Church, but from their Actions or Words. If he thinks they did not, it will be required he ſhould ſhew, how thoſe in after Ages came to know what was not known in the former. 'Tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they could not learn it, when there were no Maſters who knew, and could teach it. And ſo there remains nothing to be ſaid, that I can ſee, but that they found it out of themſelves. Now let him take along with him, that the Power in queſtion pretends to be deriv'd from Chriſt, and then conſider how he will anſwer it to Catholick Principles, to make a point pretended to be deriv'd from Chriſt, known to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from him, otherwiſe than by the continued atteſtation of Ages ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another.</p>
            <p>I forbear to urge farther, becauſe it is not my part to Argue. But when to this is added, that Doctrin incompatible with Depoſition was publickly, and irreprehenſibly, and I had almoſt ſaid univerſally taught by the Fathers; That the Caſe and Circumſtances hapned
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53776:115"/> more than once before the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, in which, if the Church had known of any ſuch Power entruſted with her by Chriſt, ſhe was hardly excuſable for not uſing it; and what elſe the Topick affords, to thoſe who would ſift it, I think his Adverſaries have reaſon to ſet a value upon it, and him no ill friend to his cauſe in touching it with tenderneſs. He talks beſides of Excommunicating <hi>nominatim,</hi> as if there were miſtery in it, and of calling General Councils, both which ſerving only to prove, that a Power need not always be exerciz'd, I think I may leave untoucht.</p>
            <p>The 115 <hi>Section</hi> cloſes up this point with what he calls another Reaſon; which is, that <hi>the Authors</hi> (he impugns) <hi>cannot underſtand the difference between the</hi> Direct, <hi>and</hi> the Indirect <hi>Power.</hi> I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am as dull as thoſe he ſpeaks of. But I have ſo great a curioſity to underſtand ſomething of this matter, that I will not delay my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, by ſtaying to ask ſo much as, of what this is a Reaſon. Though otherwiſe, <hi>not to underſtand,</hi> ſeems but an odd Reaſon for any thing. He begins with acknowledging, that <hi>if a Prince be really Depoſed, the Effect is the ſame, whether he was Depoſed by a</hi> Direct <hi>or</hi> Indirect <hi>Power.</hi> Now methinks it bodes ill, that they confeſſedly agree in the Effect. For that being the thing in which the Impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are moſt concerned, 'tis to be feared that other differences will not prove to ſatisfaction; Airy <hi>Quelque choſe</hi> being as little proper to ſatisfie the hunger of Truth, as of Food. However let us ſee them, ſuch as they are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>certainly 'tis harder, more extraordinary, and more skill is required to ſtrike a ſet mark by</hi> Bricol <hi>than by a direct ſtroke.</hi> This <hi>For</hi> comes in abruptly, and makes me ſuſpect an Error in the Preſs. The meaning, I ſuppoſe, is, that <hi>Indirect</hi> Depoſing Power is put in execution with more difficulty than <hi>Direct.</hi> And if he would ſhew but ſo much, it were ſomething, though but little to the ſecurity of Princes. For if they may be Depoſed as often as difficulties may be overcome, their condition is but tottering. But why is there more difficulty in the practiſe of the one, than of the other? what more pains, or more skill, or more extraordinary cauſe goes to the <hi>Indirect,</hi> than the <hi>Direct?</hi> Till he ſhew us where this greater difficulty lies, there appears no difference even as to the eaſineſs; though when there does, it will not, as I ſaid before, be much to purpoſe. For difficult things are brought to paſs every day; nor can a Prince be Depos'd even by the <hi>Direct</hi> Power, without great, and not ordinarily overcome Difficulty.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:53776:116"/>
            <p>But <hi>there is moreover a vaſt difference, and that ſo palpable, that ſure theſe Authors could not chuſe but perceive it.</hi> I know not why he ſhould think thoſe Authors were blind, or kept their eyes ſhut. Some who read them I am ſure think otherwiſe. But let them paſs, and let us ſee, or feel this difference, if it be ſo palpable. <hi>Is there not a great difference between the Power his Majeſty has to Depoſe, or recal a Lord Lieutenant of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and to Depoſe a Foreign Prince, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe defend his Subjects?</hi> And ſo between ſeveral other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he mentions. <hi>Certainly ſuch Powers are very different; and as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is a</hi> Direct <hi>or</hi> Abſolute <hi>Power, from an</hi> Indirect or Conditional <hi>Power only to Depoſe Princes.</hi> How! <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Conditional?</hi> why ſhould they thruſt in where they have nothing to do? Pray let them ſtand by, till they are called. Our buſineſs is with <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us, that <hi>Indirect</hi> (ſpeaking of the matter in hand, the Popes power to Depoſe) is <hi>per ſe, and properly Spiritual, and is referred Directly to Spirituals, as the primary Object; but Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, that is, in order to Spirituals, reductively,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>regards Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, as a ſecondary Object, &amp;c.</hi> And then <hi>Direct</hi> muſt needs be a Power <hi>per ſe, and properly Temporal, and which is referred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly as to Temporals the primary Object.</hi> 'Tis betwixt theſe two we would gladly ſee a difference, and a difference (in the words of the Author from whom he borrow'd the <hi>Bricol) as to ſome real effect of Government, and which has influence on Human Affairs.</hi> And he, when he comes to ſhew us a vaſt and palpable difference betwixt theſe two, tells us of a difference betwixt two others, and being askt of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and Indirect,</hi> anſwers of <hi>Abſolute and Conditional.</hi> They are blind indeed who cannot ſee a difference betwixt <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Conditional:</hi> but they muſt be more than ordinarily quick-ſighted, who can ſee the difference betwixt them, is a difference betwixt Powers which are not they.</p>
            <p>This is not to ſhew, but to make a difference; and that by a method, by which any body may find, or make a difference any where. For allow the dulleſt man that is, the liberty to alter the notions of words, and I ſhall wonder much if <hi>ſameneſs</hi> it ſelf eſcape a difference. And yet when all is don, it had e'en as good have been let alone. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding <hi>Direct</hi> with <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and <hi>Indirect</hi> with <hi>Conditional</hi> he makes but a hard ſhift to leap out of the Frying pan into the Fire. He may indeed avoid the importunity of being Dun'd for a difference, but people will be importance ſtill. For <hi>Conditional Power to Depoſe,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:53776:116"/> ſignifying Power to depoſe in certain conditions, or caſes: We who think power to depoſe in any caſe, prejudicial to Princes and Civil Government, ſhall ſtill be importune to know, how power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſome, and thoſe peradventure many; and often hapning ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is not prejudicial.</p>
            <p>He tells us next, <hi>that</hi> Direct or Abſolute <hi>Power is inconſiſtent with the Soveraignty of Princes, but not</hi> Indirect or Conditional. With the perplexing confuſion of theſe Powers I am at a loſs to which in particular I ſhould direct my Anſwer, and could find in my heart to turn it off, with deſiring him to prove what he ſays. For it is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, his bare word ſhould carry a matter of this importance. But yet I will tell him, why I conceive he cannot prove it of any. A So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign ſignifies one who has no power on Earth above him, in thoſe things in which he is Soveraign. Who puts a power on Earth, which can take away this Soveraigns power over thoſe things, puts a power on Earth above him, and makes him not-Soveraign. Call this power how you will, if it be above him, it is inconſiſtent with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty. Let it be only <hi>Conditional,</hi> or ſuch which operates only in certain caſes, ſtill it will be power above him in theſe caſes, and in thoſe caſes he will not be Soveraign. Wherefore <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Indirect,</hi> are equally inconſiſtent with Soveraignty, <hi>Abſolute</hi> more, <hi>Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> leſs, but all inconſiſtent. And it was not amiſs in him, never to go about giving a reaſon for an aſſertion, for which no reaſon can be given.</p>
            <p>He goes on ſaying, <hi>That</hi> a direct <hi>and</hi> abſolute <hi>Power is eaſily, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and many times at the meer pleaſure of him that is inveſted therewith, put in execution: whereas a pure</hi> Indirect <hi>Power is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reduced to practice, and in ſome extravagant caſe only.</hi> And 'tis true, that in other caſes Direct and Abſolute Powers are practic'd often enough. But ſpeaking of the matter in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> depoſing, neither <hi>Direct</hi> nor <hi>Indirect</hi> power is often practic'd. For which the World is beholding, not to any difference betwixt the powers, but to itſelf which acknowledges neither. Otherwiſe why may not the <hi>Indirect</hi> be practic'd as often, and as eaſily, and as much at pleaſure as the <hi>Direct?</hi> For few of thoſe who make the depoſing power <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,</hi> make it ſo <hi>Abſolute,</hi> that there needs no cauſe to its exerciſe. And there needs but cauſe for the exerciſe of the <hi>Indirect.</hi> And when this cauſe, or extravagant caſe happens (which by the way is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53776:117"/> not ſo extravagant but that it occurs often) it may ſet the one a work as well, and every jot as eaſily, as the other.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hence</hi> he deduces, <hi>That the</hi> Indirect <hi>Power is not inconſiſtent with the ſecurity of Princes, nor with the Duty, and Reſpect due unto them.</hi> Whence pray? from what follows I ſuppoſe. For I ſee nothing before, from whence he can induce it. <hi>For certainly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>one Prince may be ſecure of another; and yet every Prince has an</hi> Indirect <hi>Power to depoſe any other Soveraign, in caſe it be neceſſary for the defence of his own Subjects.</hi> Why <hi>Indirect,</hi> I beſeech you? For I ſhould think that every Prince, who has Juſtice on his ſide, has very <hi>Direct</hi> Power to make, and proſecute War againſt another Prince, as far as he ſees needful. But letting that paſs, what this Gentleman ſays, in other words, is this. One Prince may be ſecure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while that other has no power to depoſe him. For till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary for the defence of his own Subjects, it is ſuppoſed he cannot, or has not power to do it. But then, if the firſt can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, the laſt certainly is not ſecure. Apply this now to the Pope, and 'tis to ſay, that Princes are ſecure of the Pope while the Pope has no power to depoſe them. Or if you will ſay, he has <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> all the while, only he cannot <hi>Exerciſe</hi> it till then, I ſee not how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he caſe is altered, otherwiſe then notionally, and therefore will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the ſubtlety. As to any real effect, Power which cannot be exercis'd, either is not Power, or aequivalent. Still it remains, that Princes are not ſecure, when the Pope has a Power, which can be exercis'd. And this is an excellent proof of the conſiſtence of <hi>Indirect</hi> Power wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the ſecurity of Princes, which as ſoon as it can operate, they are not ſecure.</p>
            <p>He mentions in the laſt place, the ſecurity with which people walk the ſtreets, when yet every. Man has <hi>Indirect</hi> Power to kill any one, who unjuſtly attacks him. As if there were any <hi>Indirectneſs</hi> in the caſe, when I direct my Sword to another Man's breaſt, and run him directly through. 'Tis lawleſs power this Gentleman means. For indeed we could not walk the ſtreets ſecurely, if we might happen to meet a Man, who might freely kill any body in his way. But ſuch kind of Power, I think, was never fancy'd in the Pope. Thoſe who give him moſt, allow him not, with what they call Direct and Abſolute Power, to depoſe a Prince for nothing. But, when the <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> which they require, happens it may ſet the <hi>Indirect Power</hi> a work as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53776:117"/> well as the <hi>Direct,</hi> nor has a Prince any more ſecurity againſt the one, than the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 116. He undertakes to clear the <hi>Indirect</hi> Power, even from the imputation of want of Reſpect to Princes. Fond Parents ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times look more after neatneſs, and manners in their Children than Health. I think it would have been time enough to have conſidered how mannerly his Doctrine is, when we had been agreed of the ſoundneſs. But he will needs tell us, <hi>That Catholick Divines (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being charged therefore with diſ-reſpect towards him) affirm more of the Pope in this point, than of meer Temporal Princes. For they openly defend, that ſhould the Pope become an Heretick, he would,</hi> ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo facto, <hi>ceaſe to be Pope.</hi> Which they do not affirm of a King, <hi>ſince even</hi> Bellarmin <hi>and</hi> Peron <hi>are not of opinion that a Prince can be depoſed meerly becauſe he is an Heretick, unleſs moreover he does endeavor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his Subjects.</hi> What Catholick Divines affirm or deny of the Pope, and whether they be reſpectful or diſreſpectful to him, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the queſtion of reſpect due to meer Temporal Princes. But will he paſs his word for the truth of what he ſays? will he permit us to vouch him, if we affirm that they are not Catholick Divines who ſay, that a King by Hereſie <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ceaſes to be King? <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Peron,</hi> he ſays, are not of that opinion. What then, if others be? Thoſe others may carry it againſt <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Peron,</hi> for any thing he ſays to the contrary; nor can I imagin what reſpect, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Princes can expect from their Subjects, by citing <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Peron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, what they ſay is purely <hi>gratis.</hi> Allow their Arguments conclude a Power to Depoſe in one Caſe, and they will conclude for a hundred. With Perverſion, Hereſie, and with Hereſie all the reſt will croud in, in ſpite of all prevention. So that there is no way but to keep the Dores faſt ſhut, and give entrance to none. But this concerns the <hi>Security</hi> of Princes, not the <hi>Reſpect</hi> due to them, of which alone I thought he would have ſpoken. For what concerns that matter, I ſee nothing but that, ſince Divines are not held diſreſpectful to the Pope, for ſaying he ceaſes <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to be Pope by Herefie, they are not to be held diſreſpectful to Princes who ſay leſs of them. Since he ſpeaks only of theſe, I forbear to obſerve that the Argument would juſtifie, for this matter of reſpect, thoſe too who ſay more. But I cannot underſtand, while this <hi>leſs,</hi> which is ſaid of Princes, is enough to take their Kingdoms ſometimes from them, how the Opinion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53776:118"/> reſpectful. For ſure diſpoſſeſt Princes will not be much reſpected, or at leaſt not ſo much as they were before. In the cloſe, he ſtarts away to <hi>Swearing</hi> again; of which he repeats a little of what has been ſaid before, and then gathers, in the next <hi>Section,</hi> what he would have, into a Concluſion. Which I leave to the Readers Judgment, being glad my ſelf to come, on any Terms, to a Concluſion of ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a buſineſs.</p>
            <p>What remains to the end of the Book is ſo little material, that I cannot but grudge the ſmall pains I mean to take about it. <hi>Sect.</hi> 118. he objects the <hi>Example of ſuch Catholicks as have taken the Oath:</hi> a Topick on which I ſhould not lay much ſtreſs. For ſince Ill ought not be don by Example, and Good ought to be don without it, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſeems either needleſs, or uſeleſs, and <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi> the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Conſiderations. Notwithſtanding, it being a Comfort to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel theſe roads in the company of men of Learning and Conſcience, that Comfort is afforded by the Example. For after he has ſaid all he can, they were known to be learned and conſcientious men who took the Oath. His Exceptions are a great deal weaker than the Topick. All amount to this, that the Takers <hi>may</hi> have proceeded on this, or that ſlight ground. Which, till he ſhew that they <hi>did</hi> do ſo, is chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not diſputing. All is pure groundleſs ſuſpicion, to which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it neither Charitable, nor Reaſonable to hearken. For any body may cauſeleſly ſuſpect every body. Beſides, when they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves declared the Motives on which they proceeded, I know not what can be more vain than to fancy other Motives for them.</p>
            <p>As for the Tricks which <hi>Section</hi> 121. and in thoſe which follow, he aſſigns for the Takers Motives, he may keep them if he pleaſe, for thoſe who value or uſe them. The Takers are more plain dealing people. They are perſwaded it is their Duty to take the Oath, and they are ſo perſwaded, becauſe they know Allegiance is commanded by the Law of God; and ſee nothing in the Oath but Profeſſion of that Allegiance. Thoſe ſubtleties of which he talks, ſuit not with the Candor of their Conduct. Yet I cannot but wonder, that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt <hi>Malum per ſe</hi> and <hi>Malum quia Prohibitum,</hi> he makes it an imputation to proceed on ſuppoſal of the latter, when all his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to fright people from the Oath, becauſe it is forbid. Sure he has forgot his own Argument. Were there any <hi>Malum in ſe</hi> in the Oath, as, he ſays, has been ſhewn above, methinks I might have found it; for I look't for it as carefully as I could. Sure I am, his grounding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53776:118"/> the unlawfulneſs of the Oath upon the Prohibition, and his learned Syllogiſm to prove it, might have been ſpared. For Ill is not to be don, whether it be forbid by the Pope or no. Then for the fear he is in <hi>Sect.</hi> 124. leaſt people ſhould think that the <hi>Direct</hi> power only is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Oath, and the care he takes to ſhew that the <hi>Indirect</hi> is excluded too, he may pleaſe not to trouble himſelf with that matter. For we readily acknowledge that <hi>All</hi> Depoſing power is excluded by the Oath, by what name ſoever called, ſo it be truly Authoritative Depoſing Power. For of ſtrength, or the power of Temporal Princes, the Oath ſpeaks not. And in that ſence we underſtand and take the Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 126. He objects, <hi>That ſhould the Oath be underſtood in the Latitude pretended, (viz.</hi> of the Power of Temporal Princes) <hi>the Proteſtants themſelves, who take it, would be manifeſt Perjurers. For they would ſwear in taking this Oath, that the Pope is not Soveraign Temporal Prince of</hi> Rome. To this he anſwers, <hi>Sect. 127. That all Catholicks muſt confeſs, that whoever takes the Oath of Supremacy does ſwear falſe; and conſequently, that thoſe Proteſtants, who framed and took it, were manifeſt Perjurers.</hi> And therefore <hi>Sect. 128. it is no wonder if Proteſtants, out of Indignation towards Catholicks, ſhould frame ſuch an Oath of Allegiance, that even they themſelves could not take it without being perjured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not for me to undertake the defence of Proteſtants, nor do I believe they would truſt their concerns in my hands. But becauſe this matter ſerves to clear the ſence of the Oath, I am obliged to ſay ſomething, and muſt needs ſay I never met with any thing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. In places where an <hi>Heretick</hi> is as ſtrange a Monſter as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> here, if ſuch extravagancies be ſometimes blurted out, the wonder is not great. But that One who lives among them, and ſees, with all their Errors and all their Faults, (as there is no Catholick Country in which there are not bad men too) there are many who fear God and his Judgments, and live in hopes of Salvation, ſhould fancy ſuch things of them, is what I never thought I ſhould have found in a ſober man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I, but they are manifeſt Perjurers by taking the Oath of Supremacy.</hi> Pray be a little more charitable, if you pleaſe, and content your ſelf with thinking, that what they ſwear is falſe. But conclude not they are therefore manifeſt Perjurers. For Perjury ſignifies a <hi>Lye</hi> ſworn, and every <hi>Falſhood</hi> is not a <hi>Lye.</hi> What Proteſtants ſwear, they take
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53776:119"/> to be <hi>True.</hi> Whatever he think of them, I ſhall never believe their Conſcience will ſuffer them to ſwear what they know to be falſe. Nay, though they had no Conſcience, meer worldly reſpects would preſerve them from ſo foul a ſtain. For they would become the ſcorn of all their Neighbors: nor would any Treat, or Commerce with them, ſince none could confide in any Agreements, how ſtrongly ſoever ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd, made with people who ſhould ſolemnly ſwear, and by Law oblige their Subjects to ſwear what all knew to be falſe. Wherefore this fancy of his, beſides uncharitable, is as irrational as can be. And it remains evident, that the Oath cannot be underſtood in the Latitude pretended; <hi>viz.</hi> of the power of Temporal Princes: ſince Proteſtants know, as well as He, that the Pope is, and for ſome Ages has been, in poſſeſſion of the Power of a Temporal Prince, and would ſwear what themſelves knew to be falſe, if they ſwore according to the ſence which he ſo groundleſly pins upon the Oath.</p>
            <p>At laſt he concludes, that the example of Catholicks who have taken the Oath, <hi>as grounding themſelves upon palpable miſtakes and miſinformations,</hi> cannot be a prudent motive for others to take it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What work might he make, who had a mind to it, with <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> which have nothing, but <hi>may be</hi> they were miſtaken and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed there, and a <hi>Concluſion</hi> which infers, (<hi>juſtly</hi> he ſays) that actually they were miſtaken and miſinformed, and that palpably. But I ſhall leave it untoucht to the Reader. When all is don, they were honeſt men who took the Oath, and they were not Fools. By this Gentlemans favor, there were good grounds, on which they may have proceeded if they would. And I, for my part, think there is more Reaſon to believe they did proceed on good grounds, than Juſtice in ſuſpecting they did the contrary.</p>
            <p>The next Conſideration, <hi>Section</hi> 130. is <hi>concerning the Authority of the Ancient Fathers,</hi> of which he ſpeaks <hi>off</hi> and <hi>on,</hi> and ſo as to leave it doubtful to what he would finally truſt. Sometimes he would have it thought the Fathers are for him, becauſe <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and thoſe of his ſide, cite Councils and Fathers, as well as <hi>Withrington,</hi> and his fellows. And there is as much reaſon to believe <hi>Bellarmin</hi> as <hi>Withrington.</hi> I think ſo too: but till they agree on the matter, I think there is more reaſon to believe neither, but take the pains to look on the Fathers our ſelves, and judge as we find. I ſuppoſe they intend we ſhould do ſo, when they cite the Fathers. And I ſuppoſe too, that if he thought the Fathers were indeed on his ſide, he would ſtand
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53776:119"/> to it, and never trouble himſelf with other Anſwers to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>But he thought it not fit to put the matter upon this Iſſue, and after he had faintly inſinuated thus much, proceeds to bear us in hand it is no great matter what the Fathers thought, <hi>ſince the Judgment of ancient Lawyers will little avail a man in a ſuit at Law, which the moderns determin againſt them;</hi> and that <hi>the ancient Fathers are not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for an Opinion condemn'd by the Church or Pope.</hi> This is upon the matter to confeſs, or at leaſt much to fear, that the Authority of the Fathers, ſuch as it is, is againſt him. Yet till that point be plainly agreed, I think it improper to ſpend time in examining how far it is to be valued. But, I conceive, that Children, as bad as the World is, have ſo much reverence to Parents, that they will be apt, ſay what he can, to be led by them. I am not very well ſatisfi'd to ſee him equal the Condemnation of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> betwixt whom, unleſs he be for <hi>Perſonal Infallibility,</hi> methinks he ſhould allow ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Beſides, the Doctrin of the Oath of Allegiance has not been condemn'd ſo much as by any Pope. The Oath indeed has in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms; but no Pope, that I know, ever has, nor, I believe, ever will condemn the not-Depoſing Doctrin particularly. For, I think, he will not alledge the <hi>Dictatus Papae.</hi> But let theſe matters paſs.</p>
            <p>The main exception againſt the Fathers ſeems to be, that they ſpeak not clear enough to ſilence all reply. <hi>If they be againſt depoſing Power, they are not therefore for every part of the Oath, at leaſt to ſuch a degree, that we may poſitively ſwear them all; If againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Power, in one ſence, yet not in another; If againſt</hi> Direct, <hi>not againſt</hi> Indirect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if it could be expected, or were ever pretended, from the Fathers, that they ſhould dam up every wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Meander, which was not ſo much as ſprung in their days. While they lived, it never entred into the head of any Man, that there was ſuch a thing as depoſing Power in the World. If they muſt ſtand by unregarded, till they have unravell'd every ſubtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy, with which a queſtion, woven ſince their death, is perplext, they are like to have little to do with the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>That which is pretended from them is, that what they did teach, is irreconcileable with what has been taught ſince, of depoſing, which way ſoever diſguized. And this divers, and in particular <hi>Caron,</hi> think they have evidently ſhewn. This Gentleman would make us
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53776:120"/> believe he can do wonders againſt <hi>Caron</hi> if he pleaſed. Nevertheleſs, the Book remains unanſwered; and till thoſe groſs miſtakes, he talks of, be laid open, there is no great reaſon to believe <hi>Caron</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude his Readers with Forgeries, and yet direct them where they are to be found. For he quotes particularly enough. Not but that there may be very well more than one miſtake in him: but could this Gentleman ſhew he were out in the main, and did not prove as much as is neceſſary, I think it would have been worth his pains to have done it. If he be ſo ſcanted of Time, he might at leaſt more uſefully have employ'd on that Subject, the Time he has ſpent on this Treatiſe. For let him ſay what he will, the Fathers are men of eſteem in the World, and 'twould be for his advantage if he could draw them over to his party.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He asks <hi>if it be not the unanimous conſent of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we are bound to afford at leaſt an exterior obedience to the Popes expreſs Commands, in matters appertaining to him, if the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them be not manifeſtly ſinful.</hi> I ſuſpect that Queſtion was as little thought of by the Fathers, as Depoſing. But I am confident, if it had been askt them, they would never, with unanimous conſent, allow the Pope to forbid a thing, which has a neceſſary connexion with what they, with unanimous conſent, taught to be the Law of God. Or if he did, that his Command is to be obey'd. But this is the old diſh, ſerv'd up again with a new ſauce of the Fathers, and I am now cloy'd with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Section</hi> 136. He begins to diſpute the <hi>Probability of the Opinion which aſſerts the Lawfulneſs of the Oath,</hi> and ſays firſt, That <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration or Prohibition of the Church or Pope, renders a thing practically improbable, which of it ſelf, and preſcinding from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, is probably or certainly lawful.</hi> I conceive that more than this is true, and that ſuch a Prohibition renders a thing, lawful before, not only practically improbable, but certainly unlawful. But then by <hi>Lawful</hi> is meant a thing left at liberty by the Law of God, or not contrary to it. Such things are rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed unlawful, when they are forbid by human Laws. If you mean by <hi>Lawful,</hi> what the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſhould be meant, <hi>commanded by the Law of God,</hi> there is no Authority on Earth which can make ſuch a thing unlawful. And though there were, according to this Gentleman, it has not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd in our caſe. For, he ſays, the Breves which make the Oath unlawful, are Declaratory. And Declaratory Precepts, he knows,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53776:120"/> do not <hi>make</hi> things unlawful, but only <hi>declare</hi> them to be ſo. But 'tis as I foreſaw at firſt it would be. The unlawfulneſs varies, according to occaſion. Here the Prohibition makes the Oath unlawful, and a few Paragraphs before, he quarrels at his Adverſaries for thinking the Oath <hi>Malum quia prohibitum.</hi> I hope he will not quarrel too with me for making him ſay, that the Breves make the Oath unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, while he only ſays, they make it practically improbable, that 'tis lawful to take it. For I take theſe two be the ſame, ſince we cannot do what is not at leaſt probably lawful. And then <hi>practically improbable,</hi> and <hi>unlawful as to practiſe</hi> is all one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Section</hi> 137. He ſays, <hi>That it is not probable, nor credible, that the maintainers of the Oath would have made (as they did) their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the Pope, to the end he might give ſentence of the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and whether it did contain any thing contrary to Faith, or not, had they not been perſwaded, that the Deciſion of theſe matters appertained to him.</hi> And <hi>that it was ridiculous to refer themſelves to the Popes judgment, if they were reſolved not to ſubmit, even exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly, to his judgment, in caſe he ſhould give ſentence againſt them, as he did.</hi> As if it were not a great deal leſs probable, and leſs credible, and more ridiculous, they ſhould apply themſelves to the Pope for a deciſion of matters, which he had decided already. For theſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were not made, till after the Breves were come out, by which they knew the Popes ſence of things well enough without needing to importune him for that matter. That for which they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Pope, was to intreat him to hear both ſides, and not rely<note place="margin">Supplic. Withring. ad Paul. V. in his Diſp.

For if he truſt, as now he ſeems to have don, altogether to his Fancy, he may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53776:121"/>
            <p>The 138 <hi>Section</hi> talks of what might happen, if the Pope had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſentence for the <hi>Maintainers</hi> againſt the <hi>Impugners.</hi> I, for my part, love not to talk in the Air, of things which never hapned, and perhaps never will; nor can I imagin what this conſideration ſerves for, but to provoke people to ſhew, that others make as bold with the Pope and his Declarations, when they are againſt them, and with Exceptions as frivolous at leaſt, as the <hi>Maintainers of the Oath,</hi> which he knows very well may be don. But theſe are unſavory mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with which I will not meddle. The Maxim, <hi>In dubijs melior eſt Conditio Poſſidentis</hi> belongs to the Law, and to the Lawyers I leave it. Only I cannot but wonder he would make it favorable to the Pope, when the Poſſeſſion of Kings is undeniably Juſt, and the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Pope, he confeſſes, is debated, whether Juſt, or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Section</hi> 140. He is at his <hi>Indirect</hi> Power again, a Spirit which 'tis ſtrange ſhould ſo often hant us. For nothing is or can be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt than that, if <hi>Indirect</hi> Power to Depoſe, be Power to Depoſe, and to Depoſe, be to take away the Power of a King over his Kingdom, and who can take away the Power of a King over his Kingdom, has Power over that King and Kingdom: <hi>Indirect Power to Depoſe</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with Soveraignty. Since evidently Soveraignty is a Power over which there is no other Power on Earth, in thoſe things in which the Soveraignty conſiſts, and the Soveraignty of Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in their Power over their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>I ſee no reaſon to inquire farther into Probability, unleſs there were occaſion for it; and, thanks be to God, this matter is not left to, <hi>It may be I, It may be No.</hi> 'Tis certain, that Allegiance is our Duty, and 'tis certain we may profeſs our Duty. While we have Certainty, I think I may leave Probability to thoſe who need it, and paſs to his 143 Conſideration, of the <hi>Intereſt of thoſe who impugn the Oath.</hi> Of this he ſays firſt, That <hi>there being a proſpect of Intereſt on both ſides, we ought not to hearken to the Exception on either.</hi> He ſhould have don well then, in my opinion, to have let it alone. Beſides, what he ſays, I conceive a Doctrin is ne'er a whit the leſs true, nor an Action the leſs lawful, for hapning to be according to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. And where there are better motives, Charity ſhould perſwade us, that people do not proceed on worſe. For this reaſon I ſhould never have ſtarted the Queſtion: but ſince he needs would, I fear it is not for nothing, that <hi>Sect.</hi> 119. he urges Intereſt, as a good Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53776:121"/> againſt the Takers of the Oath, and now it comes to be urged againſt the Impugners, will not ſuffer us to hearken to it. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal dealing is a little ſuſpicious.</p>
            <p>In the 144 <hi>Section</hi> he would have the <hi>Intereſt</hi> lye on the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſide, becauſe his Majeſties Roman Catholick Subjects more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and have more to hope, and more to fear from him than the Pope. This is true, and yet the <hi>Intereſt</hi> lyes on the other ſide. For 'tis not what we <hi>may</hi> fear, and <hi>may</hi> hope, but what we actually <hi>do</hi> fear and hope. And actually there is nothing feared by the <hi>Impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> nor hoped by the <hi>Maintainers.</hi> For we are both equally treated. I take the Oath, you refuſe it: I write for it, you againſt it: our condition is different in nothing, ſave only in this, that <hi>Praemunire</hi> preciſely for refuſal of the Oath, cannot be inflicted on me, which <hi>may</hi> indeed, but <hi>is</hi> not inflicted on you. Nor does the exemption from that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular penalty much better my condition, while notwithſtanding I am not ſecure either of my Goods, or ſo much as Life. My Eſtate, on other accounts, may be taken away every day; and were it not for the Mercy we find, I could neither live with comfort, nor perhaps at all. For if I be a Prieſt, or harbor a Prieſt, (not to particulariſe farther) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Life is forfeited. And who refuſes, or impugns the Oath, can fear no more.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I wonder it ſhould be thus. But ſo we ſee it is; And while it is ſo, I conceive the difference of Intereſt is not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with reſpect to the Civil Government, which treats us both alike, but to our ſelves. And there the Impugners carry it clearly. While no body ſays of them ſo much as black is their Eye, they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us when they pleaſe, with ſuſpicions of Hereſie, or Schiſm, or Diſobedience, or what elſe their Charity ſuggeſts. When this is gravely whiſper'd up and down, and makes more or leſs impreſſion, according to the different temper of the hearer, though ſomething always ſtick, thoſe who are concern'd live ſo uneaſily, that, I believe, they would gladly redeem the vexation with a good part of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and poſſibly any thing but violence to their Conſcience. Who has not tri'd it, may peradventure think the importance ſlight: who has, will go near to judge there is no Intereſt more conſiderable: For what is more to be valued than a comfortable life, to which other worldly goods are only ſo far good, as they contribute? How<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ever it be, the Intereſt, ſuch as it is, ſides with the Impugners, not Maintainers; between whom there is no difference in reſpect of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53776:122"/> Government, and a great difference in reſpect of themſelves.</p>
            <p>But the conſideration of what is the Intereſt of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, conſidered purely as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, I doubt is not all the caſe. For what if every body be not at liberty to act according to that Intereſt? What if ſome body have a greater Intereſt to act againſt it? 'Tis known that ſome, and moſt of the Impugners, are incorporated into other Bodies. Some who conſider the influence thoſe Bodies have on their Members, ſuſpect thoſe Members are not always free to follow what would be their Intereſt, if they were not of thoſe Bodies, and apprehend that their own particular Intereſt is changed, and their greateſt and ſtrongeſt Intereſt now is to ſtick to that of their Bodies. Becauſe they imagin he lives untowardly in a Body, who is at perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual variance with it; and out of it perhaps he could not live at all. Truly therefore the conſideration of the Intereſt of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, concerns only thoſe who are not Members of other Bodies, unleſs thoſe Bodies have no Intereſt which claſhes with the Intereſt of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects. And their Intereſt, in relation to the Civil Government, it is to maintain the Oath, and comply with the Laws in every thing, where with a ſafe Conſcience they may. Becauſe they have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt but the Intereſt of Subjects. If any of theſe impugn the Oath, becauſe they act againſt their Intereſt, I know not what Motive they can have but Conſcience. The reſt may act out of Conſcience too, and I hope, and ſuppoſe they do. But if it be the Intereſt of their Bodies to pleaſe the Pope, there is an Intereſt to impugn the Oath, which might tempt ſuch as would act upon Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The 145 <hi>Section</hi> talks of conſiderable Penſions, and ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney given to the <hi>Maintainers</hi> to print their Books, and countenance ſhew'd them, and Careſſes made them. <hi>Which that it has hapned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Twere ſtrange if they ſhould not be ſmil'd upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, who are frown'd upon often. And as for Penſions, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is poſſible he may name a man or two who have got ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as Liberality will not be ty'd up from ſhewing it ſelf where 'tis deſerv'd, and needed. But I have not heard ſo much as of a ſingle man, who with all his Penſions, and all his Preſents, has grown rich by maintaining the Oath. If all be true which is ſaid, he is much miſtaken in his calculation, and the <hi>Impugners</hi> of not-depoſing Power have got more, much more, than the <hi>Maintainers.</hi> But I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53776:122"/> think it beſt to follow his example, and not deſcend to particulars till he does.</p>
            <p>He cannot but reflect, in the next <hi>Section,</hi> on what is related of countenance ſhew'd by Proteſtants to ſome Catholick Prieſts, to ſet them altogether by the Ears. If he <hi>cannot</hi> help it, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; but the Reflection might well enough have been ſpared, by one who <hi>could</hi> have let it alone. For it is nothing at all to the purpoſe, and revives, beſides, old differences, both unconcerning, and which 'twere more to his advantage, to keep, as they are, buried in the grave. <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he ſays, <hi>countenanc't ſome Prieſts, to ruin All.</hi> What then? What are their Intentions, to the queſtion in hand of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? What they did, may be ſomething, but people are neither richer, nor poorer, for the Ends for which things are don. Of the two he names <hi>Watſon,</hi> and <hi>Preſton,</hi> all the countenance of the one could not ſave him from the Gallows; the other indeed ſcap't hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but liv'd, and if I miſtake not, dy'd a Priſoner. Such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, I think, will not be envy'd, and needs not be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Excepting <hi>Preſton,</hi> none of his countenanc't Prieſts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Oath.</p>
            <p>The Countenance ſhew'd to the <hi>Seculars</hi> againſt the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, was in their <hi>Wisbich</hi> differences, before the Oath was made. The Proteſtants would not ſuffer the <hi>Seculars</hi> to be run totally down: but afforded them means to defend themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd at their Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome ſay furthered it, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them a fair Hearing there. For when they went of themſelves, ſiniſter Informations had ſo prevail'd, that they were impriſoned without hearing. But having got the protection of the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, to which the Proteſtants peradventure contributed, and by his means an equal Tryal, they carried their Cauſe. What harm was there in all this, which muſt needs be reflected on? And who is it that muſt needs be blamed? Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtants are not accountable to him for their Ends. From Catholicks they were hidden; and they being only to look after the <hi>what,</hi> not the <hi>why,</hi> it was all one to them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants acted with a good, or bad Intention. They were to thank Proteſtants for their aſſiſtance in their diſtreſs, and more for their honorable dealing in that aſſiſtance. For they took no advantage of the diſtreſs in which they were, to grate upon their conſciences, but only ſuffer'd, or perhaps encourag'd them, to ſay and do freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what they had a mind to themſelves. If any thing be to be blamed, it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53776:123"/> the diſtreſs to which they were driven, and thoſe who drove them. For 'tis indeed hard, and ſomething ſhameful, that Catholicks ſhould by Catholicks be reduc't to ſtand in need of Proteſtants. But had they not been diſtreſſed, neither had Proteſtants had occaſion to aſſiſt them, nor Catholicks occaſion of their aſſiſtance. However it be, I know not why ſo unconcerning an occaſion muſt needs be taken, to renew the memory of theſe things, which ſerve for nothing but to urge thoſe, who are concern'd, to freſh reſentments, and engage them in freſh broils, which may drive them a ſecond time to need the aſſiſtance of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Yet he cannot but note farther, That <hi>as concerning the preſent point</hi> (for what has been ſaid hitherto it ſeems he is aware i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unconcerning) <hi>the Proteſtants countenanc't the Prieſts who defended the Oath, and not thoſe who oppos'd it.</hi> Great reaſon he has doubtleſs, to take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly of Proteſtants, that they do not countenance thoſe whoſe Principles they take to be inconſiſtent with Civil Government. But hence <hi>appears, that Proteſtants are of opinion, that the Defenders of the Oath are againſt the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but not the Oppoſers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſince they join with the former, and not with the later; and ſure they would join with the Enemies of our Church, in their opinion, and not with her Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What may this mean? For notwithſtanding the <hi>Appearing</hi> he talks of, he knows very well, that Proteſtants are not of opinion, that the Defenders of the Oath, are againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they countenance the <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> only, not the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> the <hi>Friend to Civil Government,</hi> not the <hi>Enemy to our Church.</hi> For they puniſh the Friend of it, notwithſtanding all their joining with him. When people make Arguments againſt their own knowledge, I know not what to think. But I perceive, that by making it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, whether to Proteſtants, or Catholicks, or both, that they join together in Principles of Loyalty, as if they join'd in Religion too, the conduct of Proteſtants troubles him, and he would gladly have them forbear ſhewing any countenance to thoſe who are not of his way. By which means it may be hoped in time, that All will paſs over to it, and the <hi>Impugners</hi> be the only men. As indeed, could he perſwade Proteſtants to do as he would have them, and fright Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks by the fear of being made paſs for Enemies of the Church, the buſineſs would be in a fair way.</p>
            <p>His laſt <hi>Section</hi> is beſtow'd on the whether Defence or Praiſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53776:123"/> Gentlemen, and concerns only themſelves. I will not meddle with it, becauſe it were to bring their Credit into queſtion, and I have a great averſion from medling with the reputation of any body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abſolute neceſſity. On the contrary, I wiſh them all manner of Good, and particularly, that to the reſt of their Praiſes might be added the Defence of the Oath of Allegiance, and that when they need Apologies, they may find better than thoſe alledged here, which to my thinking are not very good.</p>
            <p>And ſo we are come at laſt to his Concluſion, conſiſting of two parts, whereof the Firſt believes, that conſcientious Catholicks will, on peruſal of what he has written, have at leaſt ſome rational Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to take the Oath, which is enough to make them forbear it, ſince they ſwear to take it <hi>Heartily,</hi> or without Reluctance. In my opinion Reluctance is an odd fruit for him to expect from all his pains, and a ſtrange kind of ſatisfaction to offer to his Reader at laſt. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance</hi> agrees as ill with <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> as with <hi>Heartily.</hi> This is upon the matter to ſay, I undertook to take away the ſcruples concerning the Oath, but ſo I can but cauſe one, I care for no more. For Reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is pure ſcruple; who feels it againſt Taking, will feel it alſo againſt Refuſing the Oath, and remain diſſatisfi'd either way. So that the Satisfaction he promiſes, reſolves at laſt into Diſſatisfaction. It does not mend the matter to call his Reluctance, as he does, Rational. For put thoſe two together, and they ſignifie Reaſons which do not ſatisfie; ſince if they did, there could be no Reluctance in proceeding according to ſatisfactory reaſon, or with ſatisfaction. Methinks it needed not have been diſcovered ſo plainly, that after all the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory reaſons which he has brought againſt the Oath, what he finally truſts to, is, that his Reader will remain unſatisfi'd. For nothing can be plainer than that Reluctance imports not-ſatisfaction in its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Objection it ſelf, which I, for my part, thought not conſiderable enough to return a ſecond time, has been ſpoken to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And there it was ſaid, that 'tis not <hi>Reluctance</hi> or <hi>not Reluctance,</hi> but <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>not Duty</hi> which truly preſſes. If he can ſatisfie any man that 'tis his Duty to refuſe the Oath, that man will refuſe it for a better Reaſon than Reluctance. But who is ſatisfi'd that 'tis his Duty to take it, muſt be a ſtrange man if he find Reluctance in doing his Duty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of his Concluſion <hi>ſums up the ſubſtance of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and concludes his Adverſaries deſtitute of all rational Motives, and that nothing but</hi> Ignorance <hi>or</hi> Obſtinacy <hi>can move them to ſtand
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53776:124"/> out.</hi> 'Tis not amiſs to ſet a good face on the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however things go. But I ſuſpect the true quarrel he has to his Adverſaries is, that they are not ignorant enough. Were they a little more ignorant than they are, perhaps it might be hoped they might be a little more flexible too, and better diſpoſed to be blindly led by thoſe, whom, while they continue their obſtinate humor of deſiring to ſee with their own eyes, they cannot perceive to be clearer ſighted than themſelves. If he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought them Ignorant, or Obſtinate, it was a hopeleſs piece of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he undertook, when he ſet himſelf to write for their ſatisfaction; as ſure he meant not to exclude them from the benefit of his labors. For <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> plainly imports <hi>ſeeing,</hi> and who cannot ſee for Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or will not for Obſtinacy, are not like to be ſatisfi'd. But this matter is to be left to the Judgment of the Reader. I will take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to believe in my turn, that he will find they would indeed be deſtitute of rational Motives, if they accepted thoſe which are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Gentleman; That they have no reaſon to change their <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> for his <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and ſince <hi>obſtinacy</hi> ſignifies Adheſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon (for with it, it is <hi>Conſtancy</hi>) that Obſtinacy does not lye at their dore.</p>
            <p>To ſtay at every Particular of his Sum Total, were to weary the Reader with the old ſtory over again. Yet the firſt ſeems to have ſomething new. He ſays, <hi>It is certain (neither do</hi> his <hi>Adverſaries deny it) that it belongs to the Pope to decide whether this Oath be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or no.</hi> In this he reckons without his Hoſt. His Adverſaries think the Oath ſo certainly Lawful, that there is no place for Deciſion, ſince only difficult or doubtful things need Deciſion. They certainly know that the Doctrin of Chriſt was not made a ſecret, and entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to one, or few men, to be by them upon occaſion, and as they ſaw fit, communicated to the reſt; but publickly and univerſally preacht, without ſubtraction of any thing neceſſary, and by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick belief and practiſe of thoſe who embrac'd it, preſerv'd to our times, and to be preſerv'd to the end of the World. They certainly know that Allegiance to Princes is part of this Doctrin. They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know that as the Law of God forbids Theft, or taking from another what is his; but what belongs to this, what to that man, is to be determin'd by the ſeveral Laws of ſeveral Countrys: ſo the Law of God commands Allegiance to Princes; but who is, who is not Prince, depends on the different Laws and Cuſtoms of Nations, by which ſome ſucceed, others are elected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in general, he is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53776:124"/> always Prince, who by the Rules of his Country is Prince, and to refuſe Allegiance to that Prince, is to break the Commands of God. They certainly know, that neither the Pope, nor any Power on Earth can authorize the breach of a Command of God. They certainly know, that if the Pope can authorize Subjects to refuſe Allegiance to him who is Prince by the Laws of the Land, he can authorize the breach of a Command of God. And then they certainly know that the Pope cannot do this, or that he cannot Depoſe, ſince he whom the Pope pretends to Depoſe, is certainly Prince ſtill by the Laws of the Land. And becauſe they evidently ſee there is nothing in the Oath, but that the Pope cannot Depoſe our King, nor hinder his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from bearing that Allegiance which they owe and promiſe, they evidently ſee that the Oath is Lawful, and cannot be made Unlawful, till it become Unlawful to profeſs a Duty commanded by God.</p>
            <p>His Adverſaries think there is no need, nor occaſion of having recourſe to <hi>Rome</hi> for this buſineſs; nor know what they ſhould ask when they came thither. For ſhould they ask, who is King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Law of <hi>England?</hi> or whether Subjects are not obliged to Allegiance by the Law of God? or whether the Pope can make void a Law of God? They were like enough to be laught at for their pains. And yet there is no more to ask. For put theſe three together, and 'tis as certain that the Pope cannot take off the obligation which <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects have to bear Allegiance to their King, or in other words, cannot Depoſe their King, as that he cannot make void a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: and 'tis as certain that 'tis Lawful to take the Oath, as that 'tis Lawful to make profeſſion of what we are obliged to by the Law of God.</p>
            <p>I forbear to urge, that to put the unlawfulneſs of the Oath to the Popes deciſion, interfares with his Argument, which makes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs conſiſt in diſobedience. For an unlawfulneſs to be decided, imports an unlawfulneſs in the nature of the Thing, which is there, however it be decided, and whether it be decided or no, whereas the unlawfulneſs of Diſobedience cannot be without the Command. So that had there been no Command, there had been no Unlawfulneſs; neither did they do unlawfully, in that ſuppoſition, who took the Oath before the Breves were made. But enough has been ſaid of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject already.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his particulars have been examined in their proper places, and found not allowable. The moſt material is Obedience,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53776:125"/> which as piouſly as it ſounds, ſignifies intolerably both to Church, and State. For what would become of the Hierarchy? what of the Civil Government? if every Command of the Popes were to be obey'd, either without diſpute, or if any hapned, the Pope were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and obligatorily to decide it. An unlimited Obedience, ſuch as is diſcourſt in this Treatiſe, is a ſpeculation which ſeems to meaſure the World by a Cloyſter, and imagin both govern'd alike; but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable with the nature of things, and the experience of what paſſes dayly before our eyes. For it is not practis'd, I believe, in any part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> except the Popes own Territories, nor can be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unſetling the Common-wealth, and confounding the Hierarchy of the Church. To inforce it upon us, is to take advantage of our unhappy circumſtances; to bring our Nation into a ſubjection which would not have been endured in Catholick times; to which who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, ſhould bethink himſelf how he will anſwer it to God and his Country; and to his Conſcience I leave it.</p>
            <p>Only there is a particularity in the caſe, which it is not amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Who thinks Obedience will ſave him harmleſs, on which ſide ſoever the Truth lye, will find, as great and as neceſſary a vertue as it is, that he cannot practiſe it cleverly here, though he would never ſo fain. For 'tis not at his choice ſimply to Obey, or Diſobey; but he muſt Diſobey of neceſſity; only he can chuſe whether the Pope, or King. Obedience is manifeſtly due to both; yet 'tis manifeſt it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be paid to both, while what one forbids, the other commands. The ſecurity therefore which other caſes afford, by ſubmitting our private Judgments to publick Authority, is not here to be had, ſince we muſt diſobey publick Authority which ſide ſoever we take. In ſuch a ſtreight, where even Obedience is inevitable Diſobedience, I know no remedy, but to ſeek our ſecurity in the ſatisfaction of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and proceeding ſincerely and faithfully in purſuit of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, chuſe the ſide which our ſatisfi'd conſciences tell us is in the right. If there be any other way, I ſhould be glad to learn it. But when the great Road is barr'd up, I cannot imagin how we ſhould go on our journey, but by ſuch paths as we can either find or make.</p>
            <p>For my part, my Conſcience tells me, it is my duty in this caſe to diſobey the Pope, and obey the King. I ſee the Firmneſs of Civil Government, or the Politick Body, is abſolutely neceſſary to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to no portion of it more than to the Church it ſelf. I ſee the Politick Body cannot be firm, if it depend on any thing out of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53776:125"/> it ſelf, for what is neceſſary to its firmneſs. As often as it falls at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with that other thing (and variance cannot be avoided in the difference of Intereſts and Humors to which Mortality is ſubject) it muſt of neceſſity ſhake and totter. I ſee a Head is neceſſary, not only to the Firmneſs, but even Subſiſtence, of the Politick, as of all Bodies. I ſee the Firmneſs of the whole Body depends on the Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Head, for the ſetling and alteration of which, ſhould there be any other Rules, than thoſe agreed on by the Body it ſelf, by which Rules it may be Elective, or Succeſſive as is found moſt convenient, the Body would depend on ſomething without it ſelf, as to what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its Firmneſs, and a gate be ſet open to all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. As we ſee by experience, that Depoſition has ſeldom, perhaps never, been proſecuted in earneſt, without deplorable Effects. I ſee that if the Pope could Depoſe, the Head would depend, even as to its Being, on ſomething beſides, and out of the Body, which being to diſſolve the frame of the Body, and deprive Mankind of the goods received from it, I ſee as certainly that God has left no ſuch Power, as that he has not, nor cannot leave a Power inconſiſtent with, and deſtructive of the good of Mankind. Wherefore I conceive that it is within the ſphere of the Civil Power, to command the renouncing of a pretence inconſiſtent with the firmneſs of the Civil Body, and that I am inexcuſable to God and Man, if I refuſe to obey it in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Put caſe Depoſing Power, and let it be reſtrained too to thoſe caſes only which are pretended for the Pope, were claimed by ſomebody beſides the Pope, the King of <hi>France,</hi> for example, or Emperor. I am much miſtaken if any <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man would endure ſo much as to hear of it, or doubt whether it were not his duty, with his utmoſt force, the hazard of his Life and Fortunes, to oppoſe the pretence, as ruinous to the ſafety, and inconſiſtent with the Soveraignty and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government. What alteration does it make in the caſe, that it happens to be the Pope who claims it. It is the Sword which does the miſchief, not the Scabberd in which it lies. If Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, in the hands of a foreign Temporal Prince, be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Security and Rights of a free Nation, it cannot be conſiſtent in the Popes hands. For Depoſing Power is Depoſing Power, and produces the very ſame effects, in whoſe hands ſoever it be. It matters not <hi>Who</hi> is ſaid to have it; for 'tis the <hi>Thing</hi> which is inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, the <hi>Perſon</hi> is not conſiderable. A Temporal Prince can do
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53776:126"/> no more than Depoſe with it, and a Spiritual can do as much. And yet while every body would be ready to ſtone him, who ſhould ſay the King of <hi>France</hi> can Depoſe our King, we muſt, forſooth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it ſhould be ſaid, and believed that the Pope can, and hinder peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from profeſſing the contrary. As if the miſchief of Depoſition, which is the ruin of Civil Government, were not the ſame from both Depoſitions, and 'twere enough to fence the houſe on one ſide, and think it no prejudice if it were blown down by a wind which came from another quarter. Wherefore, if I miſtake not, all the ſhyneſs we find, comes from looking only on one ſide of the Meddal. Becauſe it bears the Popes impreſſion, the reverence the Catholicks have and ought to have for him, makes them fear they may ſhock his Authority. But turn it, and without minding the <hi>Who,</hi> which in truth imports not, look on the <hi>What;</hi> this <hi>What,</hi> I believe, would appear ſo intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that, were the Pope unconcern'd, I ſuſpect it would prove no leſs than Treaſon every where.</p>
            <p>Not that I have forgot that this Gentleman allows every Prince power to Depoſe another, and makes it a Right inherent in Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But then he underſtands by it, power to make War, and uſe the Victory, when the Prince gets it, as he pleaſes. And this is ſo far from the power of Depoſition, underſtood by the reſt of the World, that though every body knows that every Prince can do this, no body therefore thinks, or can endure to hear, that his Soveraign is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and depoſable by another Prince. Were this Propoſition, The King of <hi>France,</hi> for example, has Power, (meaning by Power, Right) to Depoſe the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other King of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or the World, put to any Nation, I am much deceived if they would not all condemn it, as, not only falſe, but Treaſonable. It is a ſign they are hard put to it, for ſomething to ſay againſt the Oath, who are forc't to alter the notions of words, and underſtand by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Power what no body underſtands but themſelves. Beſides, that nothing is, or can be ſo innocent, which may not by that Trick be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred faulty, it is as plain a juſtification of the Oath as may be. For to pin upon it a ſence, which every body knows it means not, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that ſence, is evidently to confeſs, that the ſence which is meant is not reprehenſible.</p>
            <p>Whatever this Gentleman think, or would have us think to the contrary, I am perſwaded the Oath is not liable to any material excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſave only Renouncing Depoſing Power in the Pope. And I
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53776:126"/> am ſo perſwaded, becauſe if there were, I ſee not how it could ſcape his Wit, and Diligence, and great Deſire, even to partiality, to find it. For ſure it is partiality, <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. to urge <hi>Authority,</hi> as conſiderable in the Refuſers of the Oath, and <hi>Sect.</hi> 118. of no force in the Takers; To object <hi>Sect.</hi> 119. <hi>Intereſt</hi> againſt the Takers, and <hi>Sect.</hi> 143. not to ſuffer the Topick to be hearkened unto, as ſoon as it touches the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers Copyhold. Now, who, being duly required, refuſes to renounce Depoſing Power in a foreign Prince, Temporal or Spiritual (for that imports not, as neither altering any thing in the Power, nor abating any of its bad conſequences) ſhould do well to conſider what he does. It is neither better nor worſe, than as much as in him lies, to bring his Country into ſubjection to a foreign Power, and that in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, and the moſt concerning of Temporals, that on which the Quiet, and Security, and Firmneſs of Civil Government depends. However, it may be diſguiſed, this is the naked Truth; and methinks he muſt be very fantaſtically ſcrupulous who can feel ſo much as <hi>Reluctance</hi> in not contributing to the ſubjection of his Country.</p>
            <p>Since the whole ſtreſs of the buſineſs lies on this point, I conceive it needleſs, in imitation of this Gentleman, to ſum up the ſubſtance of what has been ſaid. The Reader, I think, will find more tediouſneſs than ſatisfaction, in hearing the ſame things over and over again: and peradventure I need his pardon for thoſe Repetitions which he will have met with before. It is a fault which this Gentleman and I muſt ſhare betwixt us. He thought fit to repeat ſometimes, and I have yielded to the temptation of his Example, I fear too often. There is another thing alſo of which I think it convenient to give warning. The Objections which I was to anſwer, have ſometimes forc't me, much againſt my will, to touch a little on both the Supreme Powers. It is an Argument from medling with which I have a great averſion, being more diſpos'd to reverence, and obey, than diſpute them. But as the Reader will ſee I could not avoid ſaying ſomething, ſo I muſt declare, I ſpeak not of either, otherwiſe than with relation to the preſent matter. If any Expreſſion of mine ſhew like extending, or confining either, which was far enough from my thoughts, I intreat it may be underſtood only of this preſent caſe, which I take to be clear and predetermined by the Laws of God and Nature. And to be guided by thoſe Laws, I am ſure intrenches on neither Power. Though I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53776:127"/> am not conſcious I have given any juſt occaſion of being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood otherwiſe; yet becauſe no warineſs ſeems enough in ſuch matters, I thought it neceſſary to make this declaration, and deſire the Reader, when he meets with any thing of this nature, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it.</p>
